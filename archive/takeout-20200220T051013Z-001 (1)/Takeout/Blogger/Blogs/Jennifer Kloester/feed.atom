Spending the day with my mother is always a treat but yesterday brought an unexpected pleasure.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;"&gt;
Among the books handed down through the family was this treasure. A memento of Japan in the 1890s - with thirty hand-tinted illustrations (prints? photos?) of scenes from Tokyo (spelled 'Tokio'), Yokohama, Nikko and the area around Mt Fuji. The cover of the book is a like a lacquer box printed with trees and birds and very beautiful. Each page is separated by a sheet of tissue paper encouraging a delicate turning of the pages to see the next scene..&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;"&gt;
I found the pictures intriguing with their views of everyday life in Japan more than a hundred years ago. I love this one of the Japanese lantern sellers in their traditional garb and their beautiful paper parasols open behind them. The rest of the pictures are as evocative and beautiful as this one. The book was a gift from a Scotsman, Mr Archibald, to my great-great grandmother in 1895.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Gotta love a dog</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;span style="clear: left; color: #827762; float: left; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin-top: 0px; position: relative; text-align: justify; z-index: 10;"&gt;&lt;a href="" style="background-color: white; color: #da7b00;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder" src="http://www.jenniferkloester.com/uploads/1/3/3/9/13397741/581481.jpg?242" style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.129412); margin: 5px 10px 10px 0px; padding: 3px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: -10px; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph" style="color: #827762; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5; margin: 0px; padding: 0.5em 0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: white;"&gt;Lad was my first dog since childhood and he was the kind of dog you dream about: intelligent, loving, loyal and always ready to join you on a long walk or a beach ramble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'd been living overseas for several years and on our return my HH promised we'd get a family dog once we were settled. After much research into breeds and several visits to the lost dogs home (where the dogs we wanted were either already promised or 'unsuitable' according to the staff) we'd gone out to see some golden retriever puppies at a breeder's place in the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we got there I looked and held and cuddled and felt... not much. Oh, they were cute and furry and appealing but they didn't touch my heart. As we left the pen, the breeder's eight full-grown dogs were playing on the large front lawn, but on the verandah was another dog, lying alone on a bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr style="clear: both; color: #827762; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: justify; visibility: hidden; width: 654px;" /&gt;
&lt;span class="imgPusher" style="color: #827762; display: block; float: left; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; height: 0px; overflow: hidden; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="clear: left; color: #827762; float: left; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin-top: 0px; position: relative; text-align: justify; z-index: 10;"&gt;&lt;a href="" style="background-color: white; color: #da7b00;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder" src="http://www.jenniferkloester.com/uploads/1/3/3/9/13397741/1347616653.jpg" style="border: 0px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.129412); margin: 5px 10px 10px 0px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: -10px; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph" style="color: #827762; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5; margin: 0px; padding: 0.5em 0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: white;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we watched the dogs at play, he suddenly got up off his bed and came across the lawn towards us.&lt;br /&gt;The breeder said quietly, 'That's Lad, he's been really ill and is convalescing.'&lt;br /&gt;Lad stopped right in front of me, and without warning, reared up on his hind legs and ever so gently placed his front paws on my chest. I looked down into his beautiful brown eyes and my heart melted.&lt;br /&gt;'This is the one,' I said and the breeder nodded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week later we brought him home and the next day took him on his first-ever trip to the beach. It was amazing to see him&amp;nbsp;tentatively approach the waves only to shy back as the white foam edges rolled towards him. He gradually grew more confident, however, and the beach soon became his favourite place. We'd go often and he'd swim and chase sticks and lie beside me and put his wet, sandy nose on my leg. Walking with Lad along a beach was my kind of heaven.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr style="clear: both; color: #827762; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: justify; visibility: hidden; width: 654px;" /&gt;
&lt;span class="imgPusher" style="color: #827762; display: block; float: left; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; height: 0px; overflow: hidden; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="clear: left; color: #827762; float: left; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin-top: 0px; position: relative; text-align: justify; z-index: 10;"&gt;&lt;a href="" style="background-color: white; color: #da7b00;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder" src="http://www.jenniferkloester.com/uploads/1/3/3/9/13397741/4045352.jpg" style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.129412); margin: 5px 10px 10px 0px; padding: 3px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: -10px; text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;span style="background-color: white;"&gt;Is there anything more trusting, more knowing, more heartwarming than the way your best furry friend looks into your eyes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lad was there through all my writing: PhD, books, letters, articles. My constant companion and beloved friend. A true prince.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vale Lad, I miss you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Oh, to go adventuring!</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I love adventures, always have, and I suspect I always will. My favourite is to go somewhere new with my HH (Hero Husband), hire a car or buy a train pass, and just follow our noses for a week or two. It's not always convenient or easy and sometimes it means getting lost or being uncomfortable, but it's always unexpected and definitely memorable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We once followed a series of road signs to somewhere call Il Falconiere. We had no idea what it was, but we were in Italy and it was a perfect blue-sky day with vineyards all around us, so we figured it had to be something good!&lt;br /&gt;
And it was.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HTot7LbqqKM/UXtTSMhw-eI/AAAAAAAABWo/bvTLC5y83V8/s1600/blogpost_04_1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HTot7LbqqKM/UXtTSMhw-eI/AAAAAAAABWo/bvTLC5y83V8/s1600/blogpost_04_1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We wound our way for miles along narrow roads, before finally turning into a long driveway, at the end of which was a beautiful stone building. It turned out to be an old 17th century villa that had been turned into a 'relais-chateau'. On entering, the first thing we saw was the dining room and, well, sometimes you've just got to follow your heart - or in this case, your stomach!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DruRWt3Ldlc/UXtTSBeGMoI/AAAAAAAABWs/sLoYJYJQcMc/s1600/blogpost_04_2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DruRWt3Ldlc/UXtTSBeGMoI/AAAAAAAABWs/sLoYJYJQcMc/s1600/blogpost_04_2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What followed was one of the most memorable meals we've ever had with delicious home-baked crispbreads, stunning seafood, pasta, fresh vegetables and a dessert to die for! (I think it was justifiably called 'orgasm for the mouth'!)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hYCdMuYKU-M/UXtTSHifnPI/AAAAAAAABWw/h0elW2Tw43A/s1600/blogpost_04_3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hYCdMuYKU-M/UXtTSHifnPI/AAAAAAAABWw/h0elW2Tw43A/s1600/blogpost_04_3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We had our lunch in the restaurant but the staff kindly served our dessert out on the terrace so we could sit and eat in the sunshine while overlooking the beautiful valley below. The desserts (there were six of them) were each delicious and we savoured every mouthful while the bees hummed among the flowers and faint wisps of cloud formed and faded overhead. It was a magical afternoon and it has lived long in our memories.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, I love adventure!&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>An Exceptional Adventure</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph" style="color: #827762; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5; margin: 0px; padding: 0.5em 0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="clear: left; float: left; line-height: normal; margin-top: 0px; position: relative; text-align: justify; z-index: 10;"&gt;&lt;a href="" style="background-color: white; color: #da7b00;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder" src="http://www.jenniferkloester.com/uploads/1/3/3/9/13397741/6512552.jpg" style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.129412); margin: 5px 10px 10px 0px; padding: 3px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: -10px; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: white;"&gt;The gardens at the Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph" style="line-height: 1.5; margin: 0px; padding: 0.5em 0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: white;"&gt;It was an invitation from good friends that took us to Korea. Their son was getting married in Seoul and we were invited to the wedding. We'd known the groom since he was a toddler, his bride-to-be was a delight and so we knew we had to be there. We arrived in Seoul ten days before the ceremony with only a couple of rail passes, an ancient guidebook and a vague idea of what we might do and see for a week outside the capital. Our hosts took us from the airport to Seoul station. They seemed a little nervous about how we were going to manage for the next ten days - after all, we spoke no Korean, had no accommodation booked and no clear idea of where we were going. But HH and I have always loved that kind of adventure - like wayfarers of old - setting out with little more than a map, a phrasebook and a glad heart. And we both have a strong belief in the kindness of strangers!&lt;br /&gt;From the first Korea proved to be the very best kind of surprise. Astonishingly beautiful and for more green than we had imagined, over the next few days we moved from the city to the mountains to the coast with extraordinary ease. The trains were fantastic: punctual, fast (298km per hour at top speed), clean, quiet and well-serviced with food and drink. We soon found that not many people spoke English but our mime skills (!) quickly came into play and I discovered that Korean is a much,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em style="position: relative;"&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;easier language to read and speak that Chinese or Thai. Plus, it's amazing how you can get by on about half a dozen phrases: Hello, How are you? How much? Thank you, It's delicious and It's beautiful!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr style="clear: both; line-height: normal; text-align: justify; visibility: hidden; width: 654px;" /&gt;
&lt;span class="imgPusher" style="display: block; float: left; height: 0px; line-height: normal; overflow: hidden; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="clear: left; float: left; line-height: normal; margin-top: 0px; position: relative; text-align: justify; z-index: 10;"&gt;&lt;a href="" style="background-color: white; color: #da7b00;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder" src="http://www.jenniferkloester.com/uploads/1/3/3/9/13397741/6908743.jpg" style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.129412); margin: 5px 10px 10px 0px; padding: 3px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: -10px; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph" style="line-height: 1.5; margin: 0px; padding: 0.5em 0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: white;"&gt;That afternoon we arrived in Gyeongju - capital of the ancient Silla Dynasty which lasted 1000 years from 57 BC – 935 AD. A modern city with a stunning legacy of ancient tumuli (huge grass-covered burial mounds) temples, preserved villages and unearthed treasure, that it is known as 'the museum without walls'. We stayed in a Hanok - a traditional Korean inn - with a spoon for a door key (seriously!) and a mat on the floor for sleeping. It was great fun and it put us right in the heart of the ancient part of town.&lt;br /&gt;We spent the next few days exploring the many fascinating sites and had the good fortune to meet a charming couple who included us on a trip to Yangdong, a world-heritage village just north of the city.&amp;nbsp;On the trip the four of us were royally hosted by a delightful Korean family (the kindness of strangers again) who told us many fascinating things about their country and culture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;The first couple of days set the tone for the rest of our Korean adventure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr style="clear: both; line-height: normal; text-align: justify; visibility: hidden; width: 654px;" /&gt;
&lt;div style="line-height: normal; text-align: justify;"&gt;
&lt;div class="wsite-multicol" style="direction: ltr; position: relative;"&gt;
&lt;div class="wsite-multicol-table-wrap" style="margin: 0px -15px;"&gt;
&lt;table class="wsite-multicol-table" style="border-collapse: collapse; border: 0px !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; position: relative; table-layout: fixed; width: 684px;"&gt;&lt;tbody class="wsite-multicol-tbody"&gt;

&lt;a href="" style="background-color: white; color: #da7b00;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Picture" src="http://www.jenniferkloester.com/uploads/1/3/3/9/13397741/3759441_orig.jpg" style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.129412); margin-left: -2px !important; margin-right: -2px !important; max-width: 533px; padding: 1px !important; width: 194px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style="font-size: 12px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: white;"&gt;Locking the door to your room Korean-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="wsite-multicol-col" style="border: 0px !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px 15px; vertical-align: top; width: 198px;"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="wsite-multicol-col" style="border: 0px !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px 15px; vertical-align: top; width: 198px;"&gt;&lt;span class="imgPusher" style="display: block; float: right; height: 26px; overflow: hidden;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="clear: right; float: right; margin-top: 20px; position: relative; z-index: 10;"&gt;&lt;a href="" style="background-color: white; color: #da7b00;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder" src="http://www.jenniferkloester.com/uploads/1/3/3/9/13397741/1356853075.jpg" style="border: 0px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.129412); margin: 5px 0px 10px 10px; max-width: 100%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: -10px; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: white;"&gt;The remains of our first meal in Korea. It was delicious and one of those unexpected, quite-by-chance we-picked-just-the-right-place-to-eat restaurants that don't look like much from the outside and no one speaks English and you have no idea what they're serving you but the food is amazing. We ate everything and experienced myriad new flavours and taste sensations that made the meal unforgettable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The Personal Touch</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;
Some people think a person's handwriting can be very revealing. I'd like to think that's true but true or not I confess to being fascinated by the myriad ways people form the letters and words by which they communicate. Handwriting may be a dying art these days (I hope not) but for many centuries it has been considered an essential skill. Today we know a lot about the lives and personalities of many famous people because they wrote letters - by hand. Georgette Heyer was a compulsive letter writer and below are some of her signatures - each one a tiny window into the personality of an intensely private woman.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Georgette's nine-year-old signature&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

One of my treasured books is a copy of At the Back of the North Wind which once belonged to Georgette Heyer. It is the 1911 edition and I expect she received it as a gift for her ninth birthday. It was given to me from the remnant of Georgette's library during one of my visits to her son's home and I love looking at the carefully formed letters and thinking about Georgette as a nine-year-old and of the stories she might have been making up at that age.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-87YM_diuWB8/UXtQ6FaIdAI/AAAAAAAABWA/Ix2-eXKOMhM/s1600/blogpost_03_02.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-87YM_diuWB8/UXtQ6FaIdAI/AAAAAAAABWA/Ix2-eXKOMhM/s1600/blogpost_03_02.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Georgette's family nickname&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This inscription to her mother is on the flyleaf of the first edition of Georgette's third detective novel, The Unfinished Clue. Her mother regularly read of Georgette's books in manuscript form and would offer frank critiques of her daughter's latest work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'Dordette' was the family's pet-name for Georgette and probably came from Boris her younger brother who as a little boy (he was five years younger than his sister) might have found it difficult to say her name correctly. The signature has sometimes been incorrectly translated as 'Dordatta' because Georgette's idiosyncratic 'e's look like 'a's.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;'with George's love'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the flyleaf of the very first edition of Royal Escape, this time inscribed to Georgette's husband Ronald: 'This, the first copy out of the press, is for Ronald, with George's love.&lt;br /&gt;
Very few people were allowed to call Georgette 'George' as it was a nickname reserved for only her closest friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Z7Nw9q2QhN0/UXtQ6_cPvgI/AAAAAAAABWQ/RxfBLp5zmOo/s1600/blogpost_03_04.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Z7Nw9q2QhN0/UXtQ6_cPvgI/AAAAAAAABWQ/RxfBLp5zmOo/s1600/blogpost_03_04.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Her 1962 signature&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I love how much her signature has changed over the course of her life. By 1962 it is much tighter and more angled. She has also learned the popular authorial trick of crossing out the printed name when signing your own.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In keeping with her policy of never giving interviews, Georgette never did public book signings either. She signed copies for family and a few friends though and would sometimes send signed copies to fans. Unlike many of today's well-known authors there are relatively few signed copies of Georgette Heyer's novels.</content>

    <title>Old friends</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zzH2lxn2mxA/UXtKhxP3CNI/AAAAAAAABVg/WuoD9x5Mdc8/s1600/blogpost_01.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zzH2lxn2mxA/UXtKhxP3CNI/AAAAAAAABVg/WuoD9x5Mdc8/s1600/blogpost_01.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Recently I was looking for a book - it was a particular title and I knew it was in one of the bookshelves in one of the rooms in our house. I didn't find the book, but I did find several old friends. In every room there were books I hadn't thought of for years but that, in the moment of seeing them again, brought back a rush of welcome memories. I remembered The Good Master by Kate Seredy, which I read when I was six and loved for its naughty heroine, Kate, the city cousin who arrives at her uncle's farm on the Hungarian plains and climbs up into the rafters and eats his favourite sausages. And Pippi Longstocking whose hero was another little girl - only one with superhuman strength and a massive streak of independence. Emil and the Detectives, Lottie and Lisa and The Flying Classroom, all by Erich Kastner were books that enchanted and enthralled me. Because they were about ordinary children who did things that, though extraordinary, were possible. While I loved Enid Blyton's Famous Five, Secret Seven and Five Findouters I knew that their sorts of adventures weren't very likely to come my way, whereas the characters in Arthur Ransome's Swallows &amp;amp; Amazons series or those in Paul Berna's A Hundred Million Francs seemed real with real, possible adventures. I've never forgotten that moment in Paul Berna's book when Marion gathers all of the dogs she's fed and loved and takes them to confront the villains. The words she speaks in that moment still ring in my head: 'Go on! Pull 'em down! Rotten swine who pinch kids toys in the rue des Petits-Pauvres!' Such great drama and so intensely satisfying!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are so many voices that remind me of those days when I could spend a whole Saturday reading or nights pretending to be asleep and reading instead. There's Jean calling, 'Come away now Geordie' in Geordie; Miss Flisty whisking Jan off to the beach in Karalta; Tock telling Milo he 'must help himself' in The Phantom Tollbooth, poor (unfairly maligned) Pollyanna explaining 'the Glad Game' and Anne of Green Gables telling Marilla 'how much you miss!' after her benefactress tells her she never imagines things different to what they are. And those other voices - the ones that rang strong and true no matter what the cost: Dick Fauconbois in the Black Riders who looks Jasper the Terrible in the face and says him 'nay', Elnora Comstock in A Girl of the Limberlost who refuses to accept defeat and Hilary in Schoolgirl Honour standing firm despite the consequences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They shaped my life and wove themselves into my flesh these books and their bright, clear voices continue to reach across the years and succor me in ways that only best friends can.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Like old friends rarely seen but always welcome.</content>
