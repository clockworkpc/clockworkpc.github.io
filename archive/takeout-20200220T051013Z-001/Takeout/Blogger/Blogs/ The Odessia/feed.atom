    <title>Pre-Release Chapters</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PieKHVDa0H8/Ut5rX52As1I/AAAAAAAACxg/Z2utUJSW-fI/s1600/software-development-banner_release_schedle.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PieKHVDa0H8/Ut5rX52As1I/AAAAAAAACxg/Z2utUJSW-fI/s1600/software-development-banner_release_schedle.png" height="222" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of the problems of having a weekly release schedule for The Odessia is that it gives me little time to solicit feedback and amend the text before publication.&amp;nbsp; I don't want to delay publishing a chapter, but making numerous changes to the chapter after it's posted is undesirable for many reasons -- most people want to read the final draft, it could wreak havoc with people's feed readers, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because your feedback is invaluable, the purpose of the following release schedule is to make the new chapters available to those who'd like to give me feedback -- I will love you for it! -- without blurting my half-baked writing across the internet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B85m2G_CajDuWmJWa2tIZ2hvVVk&amp;amp;usp=sharing" target="_blank"&gt;Release Candidate&lt;/a&gt; (RC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://theodessia.blogspot.com.au/p/blog-page.html" target="_blank"&gt;Publication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Drafts to remain private &lt;/h2&gt;
There is no good reason to make the drafts available to the public.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Release Candidates Available to the Public&lt;/h2&gt;
Every week one new chapter shall be published to the blog, and the following week's chapter shall be added to a public folder on my Google Drive.&amp;nbsp; Click &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B85m2G_CajDuWmJWa2tIZ2hvVVk&amp;amp;usp=sharing" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see this week's Release Candidate, i.e. the chapter to published on Friday-week.&amp;nbsp; (Not this Friday, but next Friday)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Published Chapters&lt;/h2&gt;
Published chapters and a release schedule are available &lt;a href="http://theodessia.blogspot.com.au/p/blog-page.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Once a chapter has been officially published, it could still be amended, but I hope that by that point it'll be in good enough shape to require only minimal touch-ups.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Why should I be an editor?&lt;/h2&gt;
Obviously, you will receive a 
king's ransom of virtual hugs from me if you critique a Release 
Candidate, which should be enough of a reason.&lt;br /&gt;
Also, I will 
happily mention you as an editor if you give me feedback or correct a 
typo.&amp;nbsp; This includes linking to your own blog or channel.&lt;br /&gt;
But I'd say it's mostly for the love.</content>

&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
Trousers reported:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This city, Ogressia, is in the middle of a vast quarry in the heart of a mountain range.&amp;nbsp; Those who first came here must have hollowed out solid rock.&amp;nbsp; The cave that we entered by, which they call the Old Entrance, is on the north side (or the dark side); at the southern end of the quarry floor is a tunnel that leads to an opening on the side of the mountain range.&amp;nbsp; Ogres file in and out of there all day, transporting supplies from the outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Don’t tell me you went out there.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trousers stretched nonchalantly across her lap.&amp;nbsp; “I couldn’t very well investigate it from a distance, now could I?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Trousers, I told you to be careful!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He nuzzled her stomach and in spite of herself Odessa stroked his chin.&amp;nbsp; “I was careful, but I was after all on my first official mission.”&amp;nbsp; Odessa moved to argue with him but he cut her off.&amp;nbsp; “ -- At any rate, they didn’t see me.&amp;nbsp; When I emerged into the open I saw where the ogres got all their food and supplies from.&amp;nbsp; On the mountain side and down into the valley, there are acres of lush grass, where the ogres keep teeming flocks of sheep, herds of cattle, tribes of goats, and droves of pigs, for which they built the grandest barns and sties I’ve ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;“At the foot of the mountain range is a tremendous expanse of flat lands, which has been cultivated for crops of every kind.&amp;nbsp; They have all sorts of grains, vegetables, and fruit.&amp;nbsp; In addition to the cultivated land, I saw a couple of mines in the distance and a deep, dark forest from which they carrying loads of lumber.&amp;nbsp; From the looks of it, most ogres work outside from morning until night.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What about the ogres in Ogressia?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much the same.&amp;nbsp; All around the city the ogres are busy working -- they build, repair, mend, and carry all day long, except for midday and tea time.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What happens then?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It’s most curious.&amp;nbsp; When a gong in the middle of the city is struck at midday, all the ogres down tools and disappear into manholes around the city.&amp;nbsp; About half an hour later, the gong is struck again, and they re-emerge, with a large handful of food, which they gulp down, and then return to work.&amp;nbsp; When the gong is struck in the afternoon, they all rush to the amphitheatre, also known as the Ogre Dome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“How wretched,” she whispered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trousers didn’t reply.&amp;nbsp; Odessa had obviously never been hunting; she didn’t understand the thrill of the chase, the power you feel coursing through your veins when you go in for the kill.&amp;nbsp; He unsheathed his claws reflexively; when she looked down at him, he looked up at her with with an expression of perfect innocence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa stroked him tenderly as she fell back against the wall and sighed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What about the ogresses?&amp;nbsp; What do they do?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I saw a few ogresses walking around the city; or sitting in circles eating and talking.&amp;nbsp; There were a few who seemed to be supervising the ogres outside, but they spent most of their time snoozing in the fields.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I wonder why they’re not allowed to work with the ogres,” Odessa mused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Maybe they don’t have to.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yamizert appeared at the front entrance.&amp;nbsp; Odessa and Trousers held their breath.&amp;nbsp; Yamizert walked unsteadily into her room, oblivious of their presence.&amp;nbsp; There was a dull thud as she flopped on to her bed; loud snores soon followed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Well done on an excellent report,” Odessa whispered.&amp;nbsp; “I can't say I'm pleased you took such risks, but at least you weren't spotted by anyone.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Well, there was one ogre who spotted me -- “&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Trousers! I told you to be careful!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Don’t fret Odessa, he handled me very gently --”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Handled you? Do you mean he caught you?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It's funny you should say that –”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Funny?&amp;nbsp; What do you mean?&amp;nbsp; Did he catch you?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Yes, he did catch me, but only because he shook the branches so powerfully – “&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“ – Branches? Now what are you talking about?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Don't worry, Odessa, he's my friend now – “&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“ – Friend? How can you befriend one of those monsters?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“He's not a monster, Odessa, you just haven't got to know him yet.&amp;nbsp; His name is Tazagthrog and he's Turgolga's husband.“&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa caught the words that were about to fly from her mouth and considered Trousers' reply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Tazagthrog, Turgolga’s husband?&amp;nbsp; I saw him today during the Council meeting.&amp;nbsp; He seemed quite gentle, not at all the way Turgolga talks about him.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Yes, and the way he described her, you’d think he was her pet dog, although not nearly as stupid, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Trousers, dogs aren’t dimwits,”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You only say that because they'll praise you to high heavens for the chance to chase a ball.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Let’s not get into that now.&amp;nbsp; Tell me about Tazagthrog, please.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I know this sounds strange, but he has a secret cave out in the forest in which he draws exquisite ink sketches on parchment.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Ink sketches on parchment?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Yes, he stumbled across a hidden cave one day and found a collection of sketches in there, which inspired him to manufacture his own parchments and even mix his own ink.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Where did he learn to sketch?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“He’s a natural talent!&amp;nbsp; He didn’t even know the words for sketching, ink, or parchment, but he can draw like a savant.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What has he sketched?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“He showed me a landscape sketch; a most flattering portrait of Turgolga on the day of their wedding, purely from memory; an exquisite view of the city from the top of those stairs we came down from; and a very strange scene that I can’t make head nor tail of.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What does it depict?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It’s a large burning wooden cross&amp;nbsp; in the middle of an open space.&amp;nbsp; It looks like someone is tied to the cross, but the way he drew it the flames almost completely obscure the victim.&amp;nbsp; I tried to ask him about it, but he clammed up and put the sketch away.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What do you think it means?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“He clearly wanted me to see it, but more than that I cannot say.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Maybe he's not ready to tell you yet.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Perhaps.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Well, I’m proud of you, Trousers.&amp;nbsp; You have been very brave, although I must say you did worry me.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Don’t you worry about me, Odessa.&amp;nbsp; I’m a Pathfinder.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I know! And an excellent one at that.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa gave him a squeeze and a kiss and then turned on to her stomach to resume her sketching.&amp;nbsp; Trousers stepped curled up in the small of Odessa's back.&amp;nbsp; It wasn’t the most comfortable position for Odessa, but she couldn’t refuse Trousers a comfortable spot after all his hard work, now could she?&amp;nbsp; Her eyelids grew heavy and she put away her book.&amp;nbsp; She gently put the sleeping Trousers next to her on the floor, curled up around him, and soon fell asleep with his purrs in her ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following morning, Odessa woke up to see Yamizert sitting next to them.&amp;nbsp; She had an ornate wooden box in one hand and a hunting knife in the other.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Yamizert kept her eyes locked on Odessa as she slowly lowered the knife into the wooden box.&amp;nbsp; “Get ready for Yugherkug’s Cleansing, we’re about to leave.”&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Chapter II: Meeting the Man</title>

&lt;h2&gt;
Chapter II: Meeting the Man&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/111/b/c/skull_mountain_by_redkiler-d4w6ch8.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/111/b/c/skull_mountain_by_redkiler-d4w6ch8.jpg" height="300" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The crater was the size of a cricket oval; at its centre stood a lavish mansion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Odessa scampered along the perimeter of the crater, looking for a way out.&amp;nbsp; She spotted an opening, but on closer inspection found no exit.&amp;nbsp; When she turned around, there was a man standing behind her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although the man was rather short, he was prepossessing in every other way.&amp;nbsp; He had hair like a news anchor and his face was almost impossibly smooth.&amp;nbsp; His slender frame was perfectly proportioned, and his small hands were decorated with red, manicured nails.&amp;nbsp; He wore a tailor-made navy blue suit and smart shoes with pointy toes.&lt;a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=870228332320996140#1" name="top1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"I see you've made it all the way up my mountain," he said in a smooth, radiophonic voice, "most people are persuaded to join us a lot earlier.&amp;nbsp; Are you too good for us here?" he said in a somewhat joking manner.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He smiled like a game show host and stared directly into Odessa's eyes.&amp;nbsp; All the along the wall of the crater, a horde of staring faces with hollow eyes emerged, smiling with their mouths only.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trousers peeked out from her backpack.&amp;nbsp; "Our summons instructed us to come see you."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"Really?" said the man. "Oh, my reputation precedes me!" The audience in the wall intoned words of approval.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
- "Everyone wants to come here."&lt;br /&gt;- "Coming here is a human right."&lt;br /&gt;- "Everyone has a right to be treated equally."&lt;br /&gt;- "Everyone has a right to be taken care of."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The man held his arms up and blew kisses to the faces all around, basking in their adoration, bowing and striking theatrical poses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"What happened to Comrade?" Odessa asked, "What did he try to tell us? Why did they do that to him?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chorus died down; the man stopped his gesticulations and turned to face Odessa. His smile flickered and his hands clenched momentarily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Comrade was very sick, I am afraid," he said in a flat voice. "He was very confused and needed our help."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- "Yes, Comrade was selfish!"&lt;br /&gt;- "We can't be selfish here."&lt;br /&gt;- "We are all equal here."&lt;br /&gt;- "Selfish people don't take care of each other."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Are you the Man in the Mountain?" Odessa asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Some call me that, but everyone here calls me Friend. We're all friends here, aren't we?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- "Yes, we're all friends here."&lt;br /&gt;- "We take care of each other."&lt;br /&gt;- "No-one's better than anyone else."&lt;br /&gt;- “We have coffee and cake here.”&lt;br /&gt;- “Yes, coffee and cake.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa waited until the chorus died down. “Is this your mountain though? Everyone here looks up to you.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Man laughed at her compliment. “I don’t know about that,” he said with loud modesty, “I was merely the right man at the right time. I realised how unfair and selfish life was out there, and invited people to join me here, where everyone is equal and takes care of each other.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- "Everyone wants to come here."&lt;br /&gt;- "Coming here is a human right."&lt;br /&gt;- "Everyone has a right to be treated equally."&lt;br /&gt;- "Everyone has a right to be taken care of."&lt;br /&gt;- “We have coffee and cake for everyone.”&lt;br /&gt;- “Coffee and cake!”&lt;br /&gt;- “Yes… coffee and cake for everyone!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Where do you get your coffee and cake from?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Man put his gameshow host smile back on. “From everyone, of course!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa felt her throat tighten. “I don’t understand.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It’s very simple, my dear woman,” the Man replied as hands sprouted from the floor around Odessa and started creeping towards her feet, “we all bring coffee and cake when we join, but some of us have to give up our coffee and cake for everyone else.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The faces around the wall smiled and salivated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- “Give us your coffee and cake!”&lt;br /&gt;- “Don’t be selfish!”&lt;br /&gt;- “We have a right to coffee and cake!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trousers whispered to Odessa, “What happens if someone wants to leave?&amp;nbsp; Comrade seemed pretty miserable about living here before the others tore him apart.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa pondered Trousers’ observation for a moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“But what if someone wants to leave?” she asked the Man.&amp;nbsp; “Surely some people would prefer to keep their coffee and cake.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An expression of bewilderment wiped the Man’s smile off his face.&amp;nbsp; “What a strange idea, no-one wants to walk free. Life here is as good as it could be.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What do you mean, when you say that no-one wants to walk free?&amp;nbsp; Does that mean no-one here is free?” Odessa mused.&amp;nbsp; The creeping hands paused and perked up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Well, ah, no, I mean, that’s not right,” the Man stammered.&amp;nbsp; “What I meant to say is that no-one would want to leave.&amp;nbsp; Haha, what a ridiculous notion,” he laughed nervously.&amp;nbsp; “Yes, that’s it, no-one would want to leave!&amp;nbsp; Why would anyone want to leave a place that is perfect?” He turned to the wall for approval.&amp;nbsp; The faces stared at him blankly and one of the faces looked inquisitively at Odessa.&amp;nbsp; She skipped over the ring of hands around her and walked up to the inquiring face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What’s your name, Comrade?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It’s Comrade, like everyone else here.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Did you have a name before you came here?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Caleb.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“But we don’t need to worry about something as self-centered as that.&amp;nbsp; We’re all friends here!” The Man interjected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa continued.&amp;nbsp; “Caleb, if you were free, you could leave or at least keep your own coffee and cake. But you’re stuck here, and you have to give up your coffee and cake if enough people want it, don’t you?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I suppose I’d have to, we mustn’t be selfish.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Come to think of, any of you here would have to give up yours if the others said so.”&amp;nbsp; She started pointing out faces around the wall, “You would have to give up your coffee and cake, and so would you, and so would you, and so would you over there!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The faces that Odessa singled out looked around nervously as the attention of the crowd was drawn to them.&amp;nbsp; The mountain hushed and thousands of pairs of eyes turned to focus on Odessa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"D-d-don't say that!" Caleb exclaimed, “we’re all free here, I’d give up my coffee and cake for the others, I’m not selfish.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"But why is it selfish to keep your own coffee and cake? Are you really happy that all you do is allow someone else to walk all over you? Did you come here to be nothing more than a rock in a mountain?"&amp;nbsp; She turned back to the Man.&amp;nbsp; “And what about you?&amp;nbsp; You expect everyone else to give away theirs, but would you give up your coffee and cake for everyone else?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thousands of faces stared at Odessa in shocked silence. The Man tried grab her wrist but she shook him off with ease.&amp;nbsp; He stumbled back, regathered his composure and called out to the walls: "Come now, friends, enough of this selfish talk. We have everything we need, right? We're here for each other -- we love each other. Don't you remember how selfish life was before you came here?&amp;nbsp; Don't listen to this nasty woman, all she thinks about is herself, she just wants everyone to die in the middle of the street!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trousers whispered in Odessa's ear, "I see an opening down that way."&lt;br /&gt;Odessa nodded and made a beeline towards the gap in the far end of the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- "She's right, don't you see?"&lt;br /&gt;- "She's selfish, don't listen to her."&lt;br /&gt;- "But I've been thinking -- "&lt;br /&gt;- "You've been thinking? Hey everyone, Comrade here has been thinking!"&lt;br /&gt;- “It’s not Comrade, my name is Ethan.”&lt;br /&gt;- “Yes, I’m tired of being called Comrade, it’s Zach to you.”&lt;br /&gt;- “Yeah, I want to be called Hayden again.”&lt;br /&gt;- “No, we’re all Comrade here!”&lt;br /&gt;- “But I miss being called Brice.”&lt;br /&gt;- "Selfish!"&lt;br /&gt;- "You're selfish!&lt;br /&gt;- "I'm not selfish, you’re selfish!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa quickened her pace. Arms shot out of the walls, snatching at faces, wrestling with each other. Rubbery grey, skeletal bodies poured out of the walls and collapsed on the floor, wheezing and wrestling and devouring each other. The mountain rumbled and swayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa stopped at the opening; she couldn't make out what lay beyond. A small hand pulled at her hair -- "You! Look what you've done to my mountain!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trousers reared up from her backpack and slashed at the hand. It let go and Odessa wheeled around to see the Man.&lt;br /&gt;But he was changed: his beautiful dark hair was dishevelled and patchy, revealing ugly spots and bumps on his head; his face was wrinkled and harsh; his eyes, wild and bloodshot; his teeth, yellow and sharp. His suit was shredded and barely covered his rubbery grey, flaccid body. Spittle formed in the corners of his snarling mouth and he nursed his wounded hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I gave people what they asked for, everyone here was equal and we all took care of each other!" He exclaimed in a harsh, grating voice. "Now look at what you've done! No-one asked you to come here with your selfish ideas; people need to be protected from selfish ideas, otherwise everything will fall apart!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He ran off, shouting, "Stop fighting, we mustn't fight! You all love me, don't you remember? We're all the same here!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He tripped and fell on to a pile of fighting bodies. Startled by his arrival, they set upon him and he disappeared under a writhing mass of talons and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mountain heaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Are you ready, Trousers?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Ready when you are.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She took a deep breath and jumped through the gap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa landed on a wooden sled that jutted out of the side of the mountain.&amp;nbsp; It broke off and she held on tight as it whizzed down the mountainside.&amp;nbsp; The mountain shuddered and cracked, and the floor of the crater dropped all the way to the ground.&amp;nbsp; Multitudes of bodies tumbled into the chasm, and the mountain collapsed in on itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa and Trousers’ sled flew off the foot of the mountain and carried them through the air.&amp;nbsp; They sailed over a dark forest and landed in a pile of leaves in the middle of a clearing.&amp;nbsp; A path from the clearing lead to a cliff edge with a familiar white bridge that climbed into the sky. Under the Victorian street lamp was a sign that read "Bridge #15".&lt;br /&gt;

    <content type='html'>Thank you! When I first wrote this story I didn&amp;#39;t actually intend it as a critique of collectivism, but rather a demonstration of how people&amp;#39;s bad choices can lock them in, regardless of good intentions.  But that&amp;#39;s collectivism in a nutshell.</content>

    <title>The Origins of War in Childhood Abuse by Lloyd Demause</title>
    <content type='html'>I've been listening to Stefan Molyneux's reading of one of the most heartwrenching and enlightening books I have ever come across: The Origins of War in Child Abuse by Lloyd Demause.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here is a feed of all ten chapters recorded by Molyneux: http://feeds.feedburner.com/OriginsOfWar&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Snippets</title>
    <content type='html'>To be honest, Trousers was nervous too.&amp;nbsp; He had always been proud of 
his wayfaring heritage, but now, looking at the array of bridges to the 
unknown, he was ashamed to admit to himself that the prospect playing 
with butterflies on the warm green tempted him.&amp;nbsp; But then he thought of 
his father, the great Praetorius Rubicundus Felix XI who had ascended 
Bridge #0 into the sky, and his chest swelled with pride.&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Creative Commons, Free Culture, and a Modest Dream</title>
    <content type='html'>The Odessia began, as is the case with much of my writing, with a dream.&amp;nbsp; When I was 19 years old, I woke up from a vivid dream and penned the following lines: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
"Walking across a burning bridge, the fire consuming it behind me with 
every step I take, I am left with no option but to plod precariously 
along its creaking wooden gangplank. &amp;nbsp;Looking out across the dark 
depressive distance I see a line of fire-lit bridges to either side of 
me stretching out into the horizon..." &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The story took me to the mountain, its inhabitants, and its creator.&amp;nbsp; My narrator escaped the mountain, but that is where the story ended, back in 2004.&amp;nbsp; I didn't know what the story meant or how to develop it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, at the beginning of 2014, I have a dream, a goal, a sketch, maybe even a plan for the story.&amp;nbsp; No, it is not all laid out; no, I don't know how things will turn out for Odessa and Trousers, where they'll go, whom they'll meet, what they'll do, what they'll see.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, there are a few matters of principle that will inform this project, for however long it may last.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Creative Commons and Free Culture&lt;/h2&gt;
At the end of every chapter you will see this copyright blurb:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Odessia&lt;/span&gt; by &lt;a href="http://theodessia.blogspot.com/" rel="cc:attributionURL"&gt;Alexander Garber&lt;/a&gt; is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" rel="license"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Based on a work at &lt;a href="http://theodessia.blogspot.com/" rel="dct:source"&gt;http://theodessia.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Permissions beyond the scope of this license may be available at &lt;a href="http://theodessia.blogspot.com/" rel="cc:morePermissions"&gt;http://theodessia.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As long as you link back to me (Alexander Garber) and/or this blog (&lt;a href="http://www.theodessia.blogspot.com/"&gt;http://www.theodessia.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;), this means a few things:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Odessia is published free of charge. (Gratis)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may share copies of The Odessia with your friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may share copies of The Odessia on your blog or&amp;nbsp; website. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may use portions of The Odessia in a non-commercial creative work of your own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may use portions of The Odessia in a commercial creative work of your own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may print copies of The Odessia and sell them for profit, without paying me royalties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
All of this is fine by me, as long as you link back to me (Alexander Garber) and/or this blog. (&lt;a href="http://www.theodessia.blogspot.com/"&gt;http://www.theodessia.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have no intention of making money from book sales, but I do have a perhaps foolishly optimistic hope that people will like this story and share it around.&amp;nbsp; If enough people enjoy my writing, this might open doors in the future, but at the very least all I ask is that you link back to me and my blog if you share my writing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
A Scaffold for Others&lt;/h2&gt;
It is my heart's desire that some of you who enjoy these stories will use these ideas and my imagery for your own creations.&amp;nbsp; If we all link to this blog and share these stories, then my work can serve as a platform for your sketches, your graphic design work (if you'd like to create a template for the blog, for example), your music, your audio production talent -- I will record readings --, your voice acting,&amp;nbsp; your video production, your animation, your acting on camera, your live performance, your translations, your editing, your own writing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are more than welcome to publish your material under a traditional copyright licence or a more restrictive Creative Commons licence.&amp;nbsp; My work shall remain free (both gratis and libre) and whatever you create with it will do nothing but flatter, inspire, encourage, and delight me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Community and Friendship&lt;/h2&gt;
Finally, the creative process can be a lonely road, especially writing, which lends itself to and sometimes necessitates long periods of solitude.&amp;nbsp; Moreover, I can't commit myself to anything more than a release-when-ready publication schedule, which means that it might be a long while between chapters.&lt;br /&gt;
However, if these stories serve as the basis for a host of other creative ventures, including other people's writing, we could build a whole group, club, maybe even community around these ideas.&amp;nbsp; I know it sounds fantastical, but I've seen similar things happen and it would be a dream come true to bring something like this to life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Join, Share, Create&lt;/h2&gt;
Thank you for reading this far; I really appreciate your interest.&amp;nbsp; I have no idea where this adventure may lead me and you -- if you'll join me on these travels -- but then again, neither do Odessa and Trousers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If all of this isn't really your cup of tea, that's OK; if you could share the link around though, that would verily warm my heart. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Let me know what you think in the comments below, subscribe to my blog, and join our Facebook group if you haven't done so already.&amp;nbsp; Until next time, a safe journey to you all.</content>

    <title>Chapter XIII: Tazagthrog's Scars</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YwmVw1X2Mdc/U19-P7JLShI/AAAAAAAADbk/mqhFeToMNI0/s1600/chapter_13_3418388055_385249db65_o.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YwmVw1X2Mdc/U19-P7JLShI/AAAAAAAADbk/mqhFeToMNI0/s1600/chapter_13_3418388055_385249db65_o.jpg" height="320" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;https://www.flickr.com/photos/devosdelphin/3418388055/sizes/l&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
Odessa grabbed her backpack and along with Trousers followed Tazagthrog through the city.&amp;nbsp; Ogres and ogresons were fast asleep in the hay; from some houses the sound of ogress chatter and laughter filtered through.&amp;nbsp; They arrived at the stairs to the Old Entrance; Tazagthrog ghosted up them and disappeared into the tunnel.&amp;nbsp; By the time Odessa and Trousers clambered to the top he was long gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the light of her orb, Odessa followed the bright string she had left through the labyrinth to the back of the main cave.&amp;nbsp; The light from her orb faded as she stepped into the moonlight.&amp;nbsp; She put it in her pocket and tiptoed towards the Old Entrance, where Tazagthrog sat silently, staring out at the canyon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Odessa, what are you doing?” Trousers asked.&amp;nbsp; “Don’t let him see you!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Why not? He was gentle with you.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I know, but he came here to get away.&amp;nbsp; He didn't invite us here.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“But he’s sad.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“And what if he gets angry?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I don’t know.&amp;nbsp; But he needs someone to talk to.&amp;nbsp; Stay here and keep watch.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trousers wanted to pull her back, but he stayed behind in the shadows and watched her with frustration.&amp;nbsp; “Alright then, but be careful.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa approached Tazagthrog.&amp;nbsp; He spun around and towered over her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Who goes there?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It’s just me, Odessa.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Turgolga’s pet?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I'm not her pet,” Odessa said, “I'm a traveller.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Why did she let you follow me?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I don't think she knows I'm here.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Oh, I see.&amp;nbsp; Did anyone see you follow me?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I don’t think so.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tazagthrog picked up Odessa and held her up to his face.&amp;nbsp; His eyes were like stained glass windows and his fingers felt like anacondas.&amp;nbsp; His sulfurous breath made Odessa’s eyes water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Aren't you afraid of me?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The orb pulsed warmly in Odessa's pocket; she looked down and saw that it glowed a gentle electric blue.&amp;nbsp; “I don’t think you’re as nasty as Turgolga says you are.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I’m not sure about that.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He placed Odessa back on the ground and sat down.&amp;nbsp; He resumed staring into the canyon.&amp;nbsp; Odessa sat down next to him and followed his gaze to the gently moonlit rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Are you happy that Yugherkug had his Cleansing today?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It had to be done.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“But are you happy?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It doesn’t matter whether I’m happy or not.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It matters to me.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tazagthrog sighed and sank into silence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What was your Cleansing like?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He pulled his feet in and wrapped his arms around his knees.&amp;nbsp; “I don’t remember much of it.&amp;nbsp; Turgolga was there; she delivered the knife to my mother.&amp;nbsp; The cutting hurts, but when the fire takes hold of you... nothing hurts much after that.”&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa patted his arm.&amp;nbsp; “I’m sorry you had to go through that.&amp;nbsp; It doesn’t seem fair.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Life isn’t meant to be fair.”&amp;nbsp; His ears quivered in the moonlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What was Turgolga like when you first met her?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tazagthrog’s mood lightened and he sat up straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“She was lovely -- I mean, she still is lovely, all ogresses are lovely -- but I remember when I first saw her.&amp;nbsp; She was tall and slender and very beautiful -- I mean, she’s even more beautiful now, ogresses are supposed to put on weight, but back then I thought she was very fine.&amp;nbsp; I remember once I stepped into her space in the square, and she could have punched my ear, but she just slapped and kicked me instead.&amp;nbsp; If her friends had seen that, they would have said she doesn't know how to hit an ogre, but I know she could have hurt me if if she wanted to.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Doesn’t it hurt when another ogre hits you?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Not much; you get used to it.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Is that because of your scales?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“They help, especially against knives or fire.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Do the scales cover you entirely?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Almost, but I managed to keep one spot to myself.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“May I see it?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tazagthrog remained silent.&amp;nbsp; Odessa pulled the orb from her pocket.&amp;nbsp; She held it up to Tazagthrog and its blue light grew brighter.&amp;nbsp; She moved it up along his arm across the front of his shoulder.&amp;nbsp; He pulled himself back from the edge and splayed his legs; she stepped over one leg and stood in front of him.&amp;nbsp; As she moved the light across his chest, a patch about the size of her hand in the middle of his chest glowed green.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You found it, Odessa.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Why do you keep it?&amp;nbsp; I thought ogres have to be tough.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I know I should burn it shut, but sometimes when I’m sad touching it makes me feel better.&amp;nbsp; If I lost this soft spot, I wouldn’t feel anything like that ever again.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Does Turgolga know about it?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“No.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Why not?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I wanted to show it to her when I discovered it a few days after my Cleansing, but I didn’t want to disappoint her.&amp;nbsp; I wanted to be as tough as I could be for her; I wanted to deserve her.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“She doesn’t seem very happy these days.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I know.&amp;nbsp; It’s my fault.&amp;nbsp; I do my best, but it never seems good enough.&amp;nbsp; She seemed different before my Cleansing; then again, maybe I’m the one that changed.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His eyes shone like amber lamps from behind a craggy fortress.&amp;nbsp; His shoulders were stooped and a gentle groan escaped from him as he looked out into the canyon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Do you ever feel trapped behind all that armour?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Sometimes.&amp;nbsp; I miss being able to feel soft things against my skin.&amp;nbsp; I know an ogre isn't supposed to talk about such foolish things, but I wish I felt closer to Yugherkug and Yamizert; I wish... well... I wish I could...”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He lingered with his arms extended in front of him, searching for words that he had never learned and never had occasion to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I don't think it's foolish at all.&amp;nbsp; We all need to be hugged sometimes.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Hugged?” Tazathrog asked as his hands dropped to his sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Yes, it's when you put your arms around someone and he puts his arms around you.”&amp;nbsp; Odessa stepped up to Tazagthrog and stretched her arms across his oak-trunk abdomen.&amp;nbsp; Tazagthrog tensed and then relaxed.&amp;nbsp; His arms rose up and ever-so-gently ensconced her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You are so soft,” he remarked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You're not as hard as you look.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Do your people do this often?”&amp;nbsp; He whispered, as if afraid to break the spell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We do, although not often enough if you ask me.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“How long do you, ah, hug each other for?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Sometimes, with really special people in our lives, we hug each other all night long.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Really?&amp;nbsp; And no-one punishes you for it?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“No, we're safe.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I wonder what that would feel like.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They held each for a little longer.&amp;nbsp; Odessa stepped back and looked up at this great creature, so immense and powerful, so vulnerable and forlorn.&amp;nbsp; She stepped forward and reached out to him.&amp;nbsp; As her hand pressed against the glowing green patch over his heart, he relaxed and slowly fell back on to the floor, like an old forest tree making its way back down to earth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Odessa climbed on to his chest, knelt down, and placed her orb on his chest.&amp;nbsp; His scales were smooth and cool; his skin, like warm, rubbery velvet.&amp;nbsp; The patch glowed a fierce green as Odessa closed her eyes and leaned her weight in through her hands; suddenly, the orb melted into him and the patch changed to a brilliant electric blue.&amp;nbsp; The light spread across Tazagthrog’s chest, over his shoulders, down his arms, and into his fingers; it fanned out across his stomach and down his legs; it rushed up his neck and around his face.&amp;nbsp; The light grew brighter and brighter, whiter and whiter, until Tazagthrog and Odessa were engulfed by a cool white flame that filled the mouth of the cave.&amp;nbsp; In the middle of this noiseless explosion, Tazagthrog’s scales fell away and dissolved into ash.&amp;nbsp; The white light receded; in the darkness that took its place, Tazagthrog’s chest and limbs were crisscrossed with glowing blue scars.&amp;nbsp; Odessa sat up and placed her hands on her thighs.&amp;nbsp; She felt very tired all of a sudden.&amp;nbsp; She swayed, and toppled off Tazagthrog’s chest and on to the floor.&amp;nbsp; She struggled to stand up, stumbled a couple of paces, and then collapsed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trousers bolted out of the shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Odessa! Are you alright?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He nuzzled her face and tried to wake her up, but Odessa lay still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Chapter XII: The Cleansing</title>

&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
Turgolga emerged from her room wearing her finest jewellery, bangles, bracelets, and rings.&amp;nbsp; She placed the picnic basket in front of Odessa and Trousers.&amp;nbsp; “Let's go!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa and Trousers climbed into Turgolga’s picnic basket and this time they were carried by Tazagthrog, along with Yugherkug, Yamizert, and Turgolga to a grand square covered with a mosaic of stark tribal patterns.&amp;nbsp; At the centre of the square was a stage shaped like an altar, on which stood an imposing wooden cross.&amp;nbsp; At the foot of the cross was a bundle of firewood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The square was filled with a crowd of ogres to the right and a crowd of ogresses to the left, with a path to the stage between them.&amp;nbsp; The ogres stood at attention, their eyes fixed on Yugherkug, their scaly faces blank; there was a buzz of excitement about the ogresses, although they paid little attention to Yugherkug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turgolga deposited the basket on nearby boulder.&amp;nbsp; Odessa with Trousers on her shoulder peeked out at the stage.&lt;br /&gt;The Roundbelly family made its way to the front of the stage and turned to face the crowd.&amp;nbsp; Turgolga stepped raised her palms to the crowd; the ogresses hushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Today is a proud day for the Roundbelly family.&amp;nbsp; I have tried to make the most of Yugherkug, but there is only so much one can expect from an ogreson.”&amp;nbsp; The ogresses in the crowd tutted and laughed in agreement; the ogres stood in silence, mostly staring at the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Ever since he was born, he has been a typical ogre.&amp;nbsp; If you tell him something once, you’ve told him it –“&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A thousand times!” Half of the crowd replied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“And although I’ve been patient with him,” Turgolga continued, “there is no limit to the trouble he has caused.&amp;nbsp; But nobody said an ogress’s life was easy.”&amp;nbsp; Half the crowd shouted in agreement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Come, let’s not waste any more of your time on this filthy rock snake.&amp;nbsp; I should like to call upon my sisters to commence the Cleansing.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three ogresses stepped forward from the crowd and joined Turgolga in grabbing Yugherkug's limbs.&amp;nbsp; They tied him to the cross with ropes, his feet together, his arms out to his sides.&amp;nbsp; He looked down at Tazagthrog; Tazagthrog looked up at him, his body erect, his fists clenched.&amp;nbsp; For a moment, Odessa thought Tazagthrog was going to step on to the platform, but two ogres put their hands on his shoulders and he stepped back into the crowd; he put his arms around the shoulders of two large ogres in the front row.&amp;nbsp; They put their arms around his back and stood stiffly at attention with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yamizert proffered the wooden box to her mother.&amp;nbsp; Turgolga opened it and held up the hunting knife to the crowd.&amp;nbsp; The ogresses cheered wildly; Yamizert left the stage and went to stand next to Odessa and Trousers on the boulder.&amp;nbsp; “What’s going on?” Odessa asked.&amp;nbsp; “Yugherkug’s Cleansing,” Yamizert replied in a soft monotone.&amp;nbsp; She leaned weakly against the boulder and stared at the ground.&amp;nbsp; “Aren’t you happy for your brother?” Odessa asked, but Yamizert didn’t reply.&amp;nbsp; Her pointed ears drooped and her arms were wrapped tightly around her midriff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“With this knife, I trace our people’s struggle against the belly of the mountain.” Turgolga announced.&amp;nbsp; The ogresses in the crowd stamped their feet and clapped their hands to a slow, expectant beat.&amp;nbsp; Turgolga placed the knife against the front of Yugherkug’s right shoulder and cut a line to his left hip.&amp;nbsp; He gritted his teeth and clenched his body.&amp;nbsp; A row of bloody droplets was released like ropes from a bridge down his torso.&amp;nbsp; Then a long incision from his left shoulder to his right hip.&amp;nbsp; Then a series of crisscrossed lines across his chest and abdomen, his thighs and his arms.&amp;nbsp; All the while, Yugherkug gritted his teeth, but his moans were drowned out by the laughter and clapping from the crowd.&amp;nbsp; When Turgolga finished her knife-work, Yugherkug’s body from his shoulders to his feet was painted a glistening crimson that formed a pool on the stage and dripped down to the square.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turgolga turned to face the crowd, the bloody knife in her hand, beaming with proud delight.&amp;nbsp; The ogresses ululated and clapped their hands.&amp;nbsp; Yugherkug looked pleadingly at his mother as she turned to face him.&amp;nbsp; She reached up to his left ear and deftly sliced off the top part.&amp;nbsp; Yugherkug screamed and writhed with such ferocity that Odessa could hear him over the banshee roar of the ululations and thought that the cross would break.&amp;nbsp; After a minute he dropped his head and gasped for breath.&amp;nbsp; Turgolga quickly moved across and sliced his other ear and then roughly rolled down the wounded portions to form neat, round ears.&amp;nbsp; Yugherkug screamed and writhed, as if an electric current were passing through him, until it too passed, and his head dropped again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An ogress brought a burning torch to Turgolga and waved to the crowd as she exited the stage.&amp;nbsp; Turgolga brandished the torch and then applied it to the firewood at Yugherkug’s feet.&amp;nbsp; The kindling burst into flames; within seconds Yugherkug and the cross were engulfed in fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa gasped in horror.&amp;nbsp; “Yamizert, what’s going on?&amp;nbsp; Why are they doing this?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yamizert kept on staring at the ground.&amp;nbsp; “It’s what we do.&amp;nbsp; Ogres have to be tough.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“But he’s going to die!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“No he won’t.&amp;nbsp; Not if he’s strong.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flames soon died down, leaving Yugherkug’s body completely charred.&amp;nbsp; The crowd fell silent again.&amp;nbsp; But then, a curious thing happened: reptilian scales began to push through.&amp;nbsp; From his feet to his head, except for his ears, the charred flesh fell off Yugherkug and within a few minutes, he was encased in a full body armour of scales.&amp;nbsp; The ropes and the cross disintegrated, and he collapsed on to the stage.&amp;nbsp; He tried to stand up, and when he looked at the crowd his sea-blues eyes had turned deep orange.&amp;nbsp; Tazagthrog rushed forward, slung him over his shoulder, and disappeared into the ogre side of the crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turgolga summoned Yamizert to the stage and officiously returned the knife to her, before patting her head affectionately.&amp;nbsp; The ogresses whooped and cheered; Turgolga waved to them like an opera singer and they dispersed.&amp;nbsp; Turgolga picked up Odessa and Trousers' basket and headed back home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Will Yugherkug be alright?”&amp;nbsp; Odessa asked nervously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Maybe now that he’s been Cleansed.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa looked at Yamizert who was walking alongside them, but Yamizert stared straight ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they got back to the Roundbelly home, Yugherkug was lying on the side of the road with Tazagthrog gently washing away the last of his charred flesh.&amp;nbsp; Yugherkug’s ears were bandaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That night, after Turgolga had drunk herself into a stupor and Yamizert had disappeared into the night, Odessa and Trousers heard voices outside.&amp;nbsp; They peeked out the front entrance and spied Tazagthrog and Yugherkug sitting next to each other with their legs crossed and their hands on their knees, facing the road.&amp;nbsp; Yugherkug scratched his sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“These scales are itchy, Father.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tazagthrog tensed at the word “father” and checked over his shoulder to see if anyone had heard them.&amp;nbsp; Odessa and Trousers pulled their heads in; when they peeked back out, they saw Tazagthrog’s right hand resting lightly on his son’s shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I know Yugherkug, you’ll get used to them soon.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They sat in silence, staring at the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Why did I have to be Cleansed?&amp;nbsp; Was I dirty?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Some ogres say we're born dirty, and we have to be Cleansed to deserve being chosen by an ogress.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Do you say that?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I don't know.&amp;nbsp; But it makes us tough.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I know.&amp;nbsp; But why do we have to be tough?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“If you aren’t tough, no ogress will choose you.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I heard that little creature that Mother brought home talking about their ogrefolk.&amp;nbsp; She said that their ogres don’t have to have a thick skin like ours; they’re allowed to be as soft as their ogresses.&amp;nbsp; Why can’t we be like that?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I don’t know, Yugherkug.&amp;nbsp; Maybe life is meant to be easier for those little creatures.&amp;nbsp; But we can’t change who we are.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It doesn’t seem fair.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Life isn’t fair, Yugherkug.&amp;nbsp; Now try to get some sleep: tomorrow you’ll start working with me in the Outside.&amp;nbsp; Working with the animals and the getting some sunlight will do you good.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yugherkug shifted to his bed of hay and was soon snoring peacefully.&amp;nbsp; Tazagthrog stood up quietly; his eyes glowed amber in the dark.&amp;nbsp; He turned around and walked down the road towards the great northern wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turgolga and Yamizert walked out the front entrance, leaving Odessa and Trousers alone in the living room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Trousers, I think I’ll have to stay here for a while until we can work out how to get away,” Odessa said quietly.&amp;nbsp; “And besides, I’d like to learn more about this Council.&amp;nbsp; In the meantime, why don’t you go exploring?&amp;nbsp; Just be careful of those horrible ogres, don't let them catch you.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trousers sat up very straight and puffed his chest.&amp;nbsp; “Don’t you worry about me, Odessa,” he replied, “I am a Pathfinder.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“And besides,” he thought to himself as he zoomed up the rough stone wall and out through the window, “I need to show her that I’m more than a carry-on kitty.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turgolga returned with a decorated cube rock as tall as Odessa’s shoulders and placed it next to the floor table in the middle of the living room.&amp;nbsp; She gestured for Odessa to sit at the table with her.&amp;nbsp; Odessa hopped up on to it with a graceful wall-run.&amp;nbsp; Turgolga sat down with her legs crossed at the table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Now, tell me, little creature, what was your name again?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Odessa.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Odessa, yes, that’s right.&amp;nbsp; Tell me, Odessa, what does it mean to be a woman and what does it mean to be a girl?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It means lots of things, and it doesn’t always mean the same thing to everyone, but here's the way I see it.&amp;nbsp; When we're small, boys and girls can do pretty much the same things.&amp;nbsp; I always liked playing outside and climbing things, but even then I noticed that a lot of other girls preferred to play indoors.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Did you play with boys?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Yes! They were much more fun to play with than girls.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Wasn't it hard for you to keep them in check?&amp;nbsp; Ogresons are always so difficult to keep in line, if you give them an inch they'll terrorise you all day.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I didn't need to keep them in check; we just got along.&amp;nbsp; We didn't think much about the differences between us; we simply played.&amp;nbsp; Aren't young ogresses hard to raise as well?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Young ogresses can be tricky sometimes.&amp;nbsp; Take my Yamizert, for example.&amp;nbsp; She reminds me of myself when I was her age.&amp;nbsp; She asks a lot of questions, and doesn’t always see the obvious truth, but she’ll come around.&amp;nbsp; I look forward to the day when she joins me on the Council.&amp;nbsp; I worry sometimes that she’s a little soft on the ogresons, but she'll learn how to keep the ogre of her choice in his place.&amp;nbsp; Tell me, what happens when you get older?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“As the boys grown into men and the girls into women, things change between us; it’s not as simple as it used to be.&amp;nbsp; When we're very young, boys and girls are about the same size; then girls get bigger than the boys; then before you know it, those same little boys are much bigger and stronger than we are.”&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;“Does that mean you have only a small window in which to teach the boys their place, while you are bigger and stronger?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I never thought of it that way, but I remember a girl called Susie who liked to hit boys.&amp;nbsp; For a while all the boys our age were afraid of her, but then one day Susie tried to hit a boy who had just had a growth spurt.&amp;nbsp; Instead of crying, he hit her back, and much harder than she had hit him.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Oh, how terrible! What happened to that nasty little creature?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“She stopped hitting boys after that.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“No, I meant the ogreson, I mean, boy.&amp;nbsp; Are boys allowed to hit girls?&amp;nbsp; Are men allowed to hit women?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Oh, well, boys aren’t supposed to hit girls, and a man who hits a woman would be in serious trouble, but in this case everyone knew how mean Susie was, so no-one said anything.&amp;nbsp; The other boys were quite relieved and the other girls didn’t like the way Susie had always carried on.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What a wicked society, if a boy can get away with hitting a girl!&amp;nbsp; Imagine allowing an ogre to hit an ogress!&amp;nbsp; It boggles my mind just thinking about it!”&amp;nbsp; Turgolga took a breath to steady herself.&amp;nbsp; “Well, Odessa, I’m glad you have a chance to see our civilised culture.&amp;nbsp; You have a lot to learn from us.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa nodded politely.&amp;nbsp; They sat in silence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Tell me, Odessa, why don’t you have a proper belly like mine?&amp;nbsp; Are all of your people so skinny?&amp;nbsp; Do you not have enough to eat?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Oh no, we vary quite a lot, especially when we grew into women.&amp;nbsp; Obviously, we get taller and stronger, but we also become softer, or rather certain parts of us get more squishy.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Ah, I see! Yes, that happens to us too.&amp;nbsp; I could see how the ogres started probing me with their stupid round eyes when I grew into a full ogress -- I had to hit quite a few of them for subjecting me to their ogre-gaze, let me tell you!” Turgolga laughed.&amp;nbsp; (Odessa laughed politely with her)&amp;nbsp; “I always longed for the day when I could show off my belly; I was so delighted when mine began to peek out from under my top.&amp;nbsp; Yamizert is starting to get a round belly, but, poor thing, she needs to eat a lot more if she is to achieve a respectable shape.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Where I come from, women generally prefer not to be so round, and most men like women who aren't very big.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“That makes no sense to me.&amp;nbsp; Why would it matter what a man thinks of you?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It's not the be all and end all, but if there is a man that I like, and he doesn't find me attractive, then he won't want to be with me.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What do you mean, he won't want to be with you?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“He won't go out with me, he won't be interested in me.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Do you mean to say that you ask him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Usually you don't have to ask; if he likes you, and you like him, then you’ll usually find a way to let each other know.&amp;nbsp; It can happen anywhere -- on the street, at a party, even in a hospital.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Does that mean you wait for him to come to you?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Well, I suppose I do.&amp;nbsp; If he’s really cute but shy, I might have to take the first step!”&amp;nbsp; Odessa smiled reminiscently into the distance.&amp;nbsp; “When I see someone that I connect with, and our eyes meet, and he starts walking towards me, I feel the most wonderful butterflies in my stomach.”&amp;nbsp; Odessa sighed.&amp;nbsp; “But if he walks away suddenly, those butterflies turn to lead.&amp;nbsp; And then you wonder whether it was all a dream…”&lt;br /&gt;Odessa looked up at Turgolga.&amp;nbsp; “It's just the way it works for us, I guess.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turgolga shook her head.&amp;nbsp; “What a curious thought!&amp;nbsp; It would be the height of absurdity for an ogre to make advances on an ogress.&amp;nbsp; What would an ogre know about these sorts of things?&amp;nbsp; I chose Tazagthrog and that was that, although I sometimes wonder why I put up with him.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“How did you meet Tazagthrog?&amp;nbsp; How did you know to choose him?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“He came too close to me one day in the square, when I was sitting with my friends.&amp;nbsp; None of us was a Council Member back then, but we were already very wise in many matters.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Tazagthrog came too close?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Ogres must keep a respectable distance.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Why must they keep a respectable distance?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It would be scandalous for an ogre to violate an ogress’s space; we can’t allow those oafs to walk all over us and terrorise us with their large bodies!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What is a respectable distance?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Whatever an ogress wants.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What happened then?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I couldn’t allow this moron ogreson to humiliate me in front of my friends, so I jumped up to box his ear, but when I looked into those round blue eyes he had before his Cleansing, I was strangely reluctant to put him in his place.&amp;nbsp; I punched him just below the ear, but gave him a few good kicks to make up for it.&amp;nbsp; It’s shameful, I know; I could never tell a Council Member that I was so soft on him.&amp;nbsp; I don’t think anyone knows.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Didn’t that hurt him?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Ogresons don’t break as easily as your people.&amp;nbsp; We have to hit them very hard to get the message across, especially after they get their scales.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, as he dropped to the floor, I took care not to kick him too close to his ears.&amp;nbsp; After that day, I kept my eye on him.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“To keep him in line?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Yes, of course, to keep him in line,” Turgolga said with a hint of a smile.&amp;nbsp; She looked into the distance for a moment and shook her head as if to clear away something inside her mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They sat in silence for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“That was fascinating, little woman Odessa,” Turgolga said. “You women are the strangest, ugliest creatures I’ve ever seen, and I can’t say I understand how things work with you, but we ogresses have to work hard to keep the ogres in their place.&amp;nbsp; Maybe men are a little smarter than ogres.”&amp;nbsp; The strangeness of this idea made her snort mirthfully.&amp;nbsp; “Speaking of which, the Council for Creation and Improvement will assemble here shortly, so set yourself up in that corner there and try not to make any noise.&amp;nbsp; It’s almost time for breakfast, so I’m going to see where my good-for-nothing ogreman Tazagthrog is.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa lay down in the corner of the room and took a sturdy, leather-bound notebook from her backpack.&amp;nbsp; She unclipped a pencil from its cover and began to sketch absentmindedly.&amp;nbsp; She didn’t think herself much of an artist, but sketching and writing helped her to collect her thoughts, and she wanted to reflect on her recent encounters with the Man in the Mountain.&amp;nbsp; Was it really the Man’s fault that all those people got trapped in his mountain?&amp;nbsp; Had the Man always intended to make the mountain such a horrible place?&amp;nbsp; Maybe it wasn’t meant to be a mountain at all, just a place where people could live together and lean on each other in hard times.&amp;nbsp; From what the first Comrade told her (poor Comrade!), he had nothing but good intentions.&amp;nbsp; “Perhaps good intentions only count for so much,” she thought to herself.&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>What is your favourite quote from film or television?</title>
    <content type='html'>I've got an idea for a new chapter and it requires lots and lots of memorable quotes from film or television.&amp;nbsp; If you have any you'd like to share, please use this form (which makes it easy for me to keep them all in one place) or leave a comment.&lt;br /&gt;

    <content type='html'>Thank you! I was a little worried that readers might think this chapter a little flabby or contrived, but I felt it important to put Trousers in the spotlight.  He&amp;#39;s going to play a vital role soon.</content>

    <title>Announcement: Google Drive for Drafting</title>
    <content type='html'>If you'd like to see a preview of the yet-to-be-published chapters, and maybe help with some editing or feedback, I have created a folder in my Google Drive in which I will keep the drafts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When I started this blog, I didn't expect that anyone would read my story, but now I have to take into account the fact that people will read posts shortly after they have been published.&amp;nbsp; This complicates matters if I want to make changes, which I frequently do.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So from now on, whatever is published on the blog will be pretty much the finished product, with very rare exceptions of course.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Get in touch with me via e-mail or the Facebook page if you'd like me to give you access to my drafts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>The Odessia on YouTube</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/dNsiEfxOgro" width="420"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
YouTube Script&amp;nbsp; &lt;/h2&gt;
Hello, my name is Alex and I am the author of The Odessia, an online fantasy adventure novel about a girl named Odessa and her travelling companion, a ginger tomcat called Trousers.&amp;nbsp; Their journey begins at a set of magical bridges known as The Crossings, where Odessa follows Trousers across Bridge #90 to see The Man in the Mountain.&amp;nbsp; Their adventure will take them to weird and wonderful places, where they will meet all manner of strange and sometimes dangerous characters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Odessia is being published chapter by chapter on my blog [http://theodessia.blogspot.com.au], where I will also explain how I am going about this project and also elaborate my behind-the-scenes thoughts on the subject matter that these stories explore.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On this channel I will record readings of both the chapters and the blog, and might even upload some impromptu video blogs from time to time, so please subscribe to hear more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a few things you should know about The Odessia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Firstly, this project is released free under a&lt;i&gt; &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" rel="license"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License&lt;/a&gt; (Also known as a Free Culture licence) &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This basically means that I openly give you permission to share and use my stories in your own projects.&amp;nbsp; I don't ask for royalties; all I ask is that you link back to this blog. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Secondly, it is my heart's desire that you should shower me with your feedback.&amp;nbsp; This project is not subject to any of the usual limitations -- deadlines, word limit, informal censorship by a publisher -- but I need your help to continue improving.&amp;nbsp; Whether it's leaving a comment on a post or messaging me directly or critiquing my stories on your own blog or channel, you will be of invaluable help to me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thirdly, my dream for this project is that my work should serve as a platform to promote the creative work of other artists, writers, and content creators.&amp;nbsp; For example, if you contribute artwork based on the stories, this blog will help to expose new people to your artwork.&amp;nbsp; The same goes for translations, music, or anything else you can think of.&amp;nbsp; The more people who participate in this project, the more useful it will be to us all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To find out more please visit the About page on my blog [http://theodessia.blogspot.com.au/2014/01/creative-commons-free-culture-and-dream.html] and don't forget to subscribe to this channel.</content>

    <title>Chapter VII: The City of Ogres</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The tunnel ended at the top of a flight of gigantic steps carved into the wall of a sprawling quarry.&amp;nbsp; From their vantage point, Odessa and Trousers saw a subterranean metropolis of winding roads and cavernous, pot-shaped buildings.&amp;nbsp; The city was alive with ogres carrying loads on their shoulders, hewing rock, repairing roofs, cooking on great coal bonfires, carrying huge buckets of water into the houses, and climbing in and out of a network of tunnels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Welcome to our city,” Turgolga said proudly.&amp;nbsp; The sound of brass gongs rang out.&amp;nbsp; “Today’s Games are about to begin.”&amp;nbsp; The ogres in the streets downed tools and were joined by others from houses and tunnels: the horde made its way to an amphitheatre directly below Odessa and Trousers, at the bottom of the stairs, some waving green flags, some waving blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“That looks exciting!” Odessa exclaimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I suppose so,” Turgolga sighed.&amp;nbsp; “Only an ogre can enjoy the same thing every day.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Don’t you like to watch the Games?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Some of the sillier ogresses find them amusing, but a decent ogress soon tires of them.&amp;nbsp; It’s nothing more than a bunch of ogres bashing each other’s heads in.&amp;nbsp; If you’ve seen it once you’ve seen it a thousand times.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Do you think we could watch the Games today?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Well, I guess you might find them novel, but I’ll have to carry you in.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She walked down the tall stairs; Odessa and Trousers clambered down after her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turgolga motioned for them to climb into a large picnic basket that she had left by the steps.&amp;nbsp; “I can’t let you walk unprotected.”&amp;nbsp; They made their way to the upper level of the amphitheatre’s stands, which were mostly empty, save for a few young ogresses who were talking amongst themselves.&lt;br /&gt;The lower level was packed with wildly excited ogres, who were jabbering and jostling for space.&amp;nbsp; The crowd was awash with blue and green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa and Trousers climbed out of the basket and sat next to Turgolga on the stone bench.&lt;br /&gt;The other ogresses were about seven feet tall and had dark yellow, rubbery skin.&amp;nbsp; The ogres were at least eight feet tall, barrel chested with slightly rounded bellies and muscular, tree-trunk arms and legs, and were covered from head to toe in dark brown reptilian scales.&amp;nbsp; All the ogres were bald, had round orange or yellow eyes, and small, neatly shaped round ears.&amp;nbsp; They wore animal skin loincloths and were barefoot.&amp;nbsp; The ogresses wore animal skin skirts and tops or dresses, and leather sandals; they adorned themselves with all manner of trinkets, patterns, and markings.&amp;nbsp; As most of the adult ogresses were quite fat, their clothes did little more than accentuate their folds of flesh and the rotundity of their stomachs, which Odessa soon discovered they displayed with pride.&amp;nbsp; They had wiry black or grey hair past their long, pointed ears and slanted yellow eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two teams of large ogres filed into the centre of the amphitheatre, one group wearing blue armbands, the other wearing green.&amp;nbsp; They lined up against each other.&amp;nbsp; “Those are the Demes,” Turgolga pointed out, “half the ogres follow the Blues, half follow the Greens.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“How do they decide which to follow?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It generally runs in families.&amp;nbsp; My son Yugerkug supports the Greens, like his, ahem, father, Tazagthrog.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What about you?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I suppose I would pick the Greens if I had to, but Council Member ogresses have better things to do than pay attention to what ogres get up to in the Dome.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An announcer wearing a blue and green robe, waved theatrically to the crowd, which responded with raucous cheers and chants.&amp;nbsp; The announcer give a signal, a loud gong sounded, and the two groups proceeded to brawl ferociously until only one fighter with a green armband was left standing.&amp;nbsp; As the ogres in the centre did battle, the crowd erupted like enraged baboons, and fights broke out all around the stadium.&amp;nbsp; By the end of the official fight there were dazed ogres strewn about the stands.&amp;nbsp; For a while the noise died down as those left standing sat down for a rest, and after a while the rest of the ogres picked themselves up and groggily dusted themselves off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“My goodness,” Odessa said, “do ogres always carry on like this?&amp;nbsp; Isn’t it dangerous for you and the other ogresses?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Ogres enjoy fighting and killing; it’s pretty much the only thing that makes them happy.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Did you say they enjoy killing?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Yes, that’s why the next Games are with animals.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa watched in horror as gargantuan pigs and bulls were lead into a pen in the amphitheatre.&amp;nbsp; The master of ceremonies gesticulated theatrically and pointed out random ogres from the crowd, who whooped with delight.&amp;nbsp; The volunteers lined up at a gate and when one of the animals was released from the holding pen, the nominated volunteer took off after it.&amp;nbsp; The animal, terrified by the roar of the crowd, ran around the sand frantically, trying to find a way out and kicking or biting whenever its hunter drew near.&amp;nbsp; One by one, each animal was chased down and beaten to death.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes when an animal was knocked down, the triumphant ogre put his fist through its skull, or ripped its head off, or held it up to the baying crowd before ripping out its jugular.&amp;nbsp; Each time an animal’s life was extinguished the spectators went wild with ecstasy, and occasionally an ogre from the crowd rushed into the centre, grabbed the animal’s corpse and flung it around like a ragdoll.&amp;nbsp; Others rushed to remove him, which led to another brawl, to the crowd’s delight.&amp;nbsp; Eventually, all the animals were killed, and their remains were carried off in large sacks by the proud volunteers.&amp;nbsp; The ogre horde streamed out of the amphitheatre, chanting and clapping and whooping like gorillas.&amp;nbsp; Silence and the smell of blood filled the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By this time, Odessa had climbed back into the basket, pale and weak with disgust.&amp;nbsp; Ogres bashing each other senseless was one thing, but torturing animals for sport?&amp;nbsp; She felt ill.&amp;nbsp; During the running of the bulls, Trousers stayed outside the basket and stood at full attention, his eyes wide open and his ears pricked up.&amp;nbsp; Odessa reached for him from the basket but he remained glued to the action until she pulled him in.&amp;nbsp; When she let go of him, he skipped out of the basket and continued watching attentively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they made their way through the streets, Odessa and Trousers peeked out of the basket.&amp;nbsp; The ogres had returned to work by then.&amp;nbsp; As Turgolga walked passed them, they instinctively stopped working, stooped their shoulders to bring themselves to her level, and dropped their gaze.&amp;nbsp; Turgolga cursed the ogres that didn’t move quickly enough out of her way, and when an ogre carrying a large rock brushed against her as he stepped aside, she wheeled around and slapped him powerfully across the face.&amp;nbsp; He rocked back, regained his balance, and quickly moved away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I suppose Turgolga has to be stern with them, otherwise they’d rip her apart,” Odessa mused.&amp;nbsp; “She must be brave to walk the streets with these nasty brutes about.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they passed a large square in the centre of town, Odessa and Trousers noticed groups of young ogres (known as ogresons) and young ogresses playing separately.&amp;nbsp; Both groups were almost as tall as adults; the ogresons’ skin was smooth and dark yellow, and they were much more slender than the adult males; unlike the adults, they all had large pointed ears and blue or green eyes.&amp;nbsp; The young ogresses were tall and lithe, with long braided or dreadlocked hair and almond-shaped yellow eyes.&amp;nbsp; The ogresons played boisterously -- wrestling, picking each other up, jumping acrobatically over each other.&amp;nbsp; The young ogresses mainly sat in circles and talked all at the same time.&amp;nbsp; An ogreson absentmindedly brushed against an ogress who was chatting with her friends; she leapt up and punched his ear.&amp;nbsp; He dropped to the ground clutching his head, and the ogresses and his own friends set upon him, screaming, kicking, and punching until he crawled away from their attacks.&amp;nbsp; He sat sulking for a while and massaged his wounded ear.&amp;nbsp; “It seems their ears are the only part of them that hurts,” Odessa remarked.&amp;nbsp; “I wonder why none of the adult ogres have pointed ears,” Trousers mused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrived at a large round house that was carved entirely from solid rock.&amp;nbsp; Turgolga strode through the front door and deposited the basket on the floor.&amp;nbsp; Odessa and Trousers climbed out into a vast living room with a low table in the centre.&amp;nbsp; Straight in front was a doorway that led the bonfire in the backyard, to the left and to the right were bedrooms, immediately outside the front entrance Odessa had noticed two sections neatly covered with hay.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What’s the hay out the front for?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Don’t mind the mess over there,” Turgolga said with embarrassment, “that’s where the ogres sleep. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Which ogres?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Tazagthrog and Yugerkug of course!&amp;nbsp; I know I should make them sleep in a ditch somewhere, but I’m too soft for my own good sometimes.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Don’t they sleep in the house?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turgolga snorted.&amp;nbsp; “What a strange idea!&amp;nbsp; Where do you imagine I’m supposed to put them?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Where I come from, you and Tazagthrog would sleep together, in the same bed.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Look here,” Turgolga said, with her hands on her hips, “I don’t know what sort of things you little people do, but I’m a respectable ogress.&amp;nbsp; According to the elder ogresses it borders on scandalous that I allowed Tazagthrog into my chamber on two occasions, especially after the first time produced an ogress.&amp;nbsp; Once Tazagthrog finished the lowly work on our home, his place has been either outside the front door or in the kitchen.&amp;nbsp; As I was saying, I’ve told them both a thousand times to keep their hay tidy, but they never listen.”&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She tutted in annoyance and then remembered her duties as hostess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“At any rate, welcome to my home! I’m going to design a meal for Tazagthrog to make when he gets back from work, but first let me introduce you to my children.&amp;nbsp; Yamizert, Yugerkug, come here!&amp;nbsp; I’ve got a surprise for you!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yamizert, a young ogress, emerged from the bedroom on the left and Yugerkug, an ogreson, walked in through the front door.&amp;nbsp; Yamizert stood at her mother’s height, had her mother’s wiry hair, pointed ears, and slanted yellow eyes.&amp;nbsp; She was so slim (as far as ogresses were concerned) that her stomach barely protruded from under her top.&amp;nbsp; She looked suspiciously at Odessa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Ew! What is this ridiculous insect?&amp;nbsp; I wanted a cow to play with or at least something big enough to eat -- this, uh, this thing isn’t even worth a snack!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“She’s not a ‘thing’ and she’s not for eating, Yamizert,” Turgolga explained, “she’s a -- what are you again?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I’m a woman,” Odessa said, “although some people think I’m still a girl.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What’s the difference?” Yamizert asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It’s something to do with climbing trees,” Turgolga replied.&amp;nbsp; “Now, please, Yamizert, you can’t eat her and you can’t play with her either: I think she breaks easily.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Whatever she is, I think she’s silly.&amp;nbsp; I don’t know why you waste my time with this rubbish.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Now now, Yamizert,” Turgolga said patiently, “she’s a very interesting creature.&amp;nbsp; Please be careful with her, that’s all I ask.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yugerkug was Yamizert’s younger brother.&amp;nbsp; He was already the height of an adult ogre, although his limbs were not as powerfully built yet.&amp;nbsp; He had large pointed ears and his body and face were smooth except for a couple of small patches of reptilian scales on his arms and legs.&amp;nbsp; His round sea-blue eyes were bright with curiosity.&amp;nbsp; “Mother, she’s like a tiny hobgoblin! Wha’ we gonna call her?”&amp;nbsp; He asked as he took a step towards Odessa to a better look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turgolga quickly stepped up to Yugerkug and slapped him viciously across the face.&amp;nbsp; Yugerkug crashed on to the floor.&amp;nbsp; Odessa and Trousers ran to the far end of the room.&amp;nbsp; “Don’t you dare speak to me like that, you filthy toad!” She screamed.&amp;nbsp; “How dare you speak to an ogress in that tone of voice!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yugerkug squirmed on the floor and held his hands up to protect his face.&amp;nbsp; Turgolga grabbed his wrists in one hand punched him on the side with the other.&amp;nbsp; “Keep your mouth shut or I’ll give you a real hiding.&amp;nbsp; Speak to an ogress when you’re spoken to, understand?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yugerkug was not sure whether to answer or not, so he nodded his head energetically.&amp;nbsp; Turgolga kicked him in the ribs.&amp;nbsp; “And don’t you dare touch my pet woman, or you’ll be in serious trouble.&amp;nbsp; Now get out!”&amp;nbsp; Yugerkug scurried out of the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turgolga stomped towards Odessa and Trousers and towered over them, her shoulders heaving, her nostrils flared.&amp;nbsp; She took a deep breath and smiled calmly.&amp;nbsp; “I’m sorry that he got so close to you.&amp;nbsp; I try so hard with him, but I can never be sure what he’ll get up to next.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa tried to keep her voice steady.&amp;nbsp; “I understand, I’ll try to be careful.”&lt;br /&gt;

Chapter III: The Piano in the Park&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="333" mozallowfullscreen="" msallowfullscreen="" oallowfullscreen="" src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sbirenda/9382312957/player/42fa94166e" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="500"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bridge #15 took Odessa and her feline companion, Praetorius Pathfinder XII (known to his friends as Trousers) to an island in the clouds, and deposited them on a platform on the branch of a tall oak tree.&amp;nbsp; Trousers rode in Odessa’s bag as she climbed down a rope ladder.&amp;nbsp; When she reached the ground, she found herself in an English garden.&amp;nbsp; In the distance was a village on top of a hill.&amp;nbsp; The sunlight through the leaves created a speckled pattern on the manicured grass.&amp;nbsp; Odessa put away her jacket and top and felt a delicious shiver as the sun stroked her face and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They followed a nearby gravel path through a small forest and into a clearing, at the centre of which stood a black piano.&amp;nbsp; There were three other paths that lead to this clearing and a large sign that read, “Play me, please.”&amp;nbsp; Two small children, a brother and a sister ran up to it and sat down together on the piano stool.&amp;nbsp; They banged away at the keys with noisy delight and their parents, who arrived soon after, said, “Well done, Sebastian, what will the little maestro think of next?” and “Yes, Esmerelda, that sounds beautiful!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa stood next to the piano and waited patiently for her turn.&amp;nbsp; She loved seeing little children at play, but she was also itching to get her hands on it; although she was not an accomplished pianist, anyone who plays knows how enticing those black-and-white keys can be.&amp;nbsp; Even a modest player like her could envelope herself in layers of music with nothing more than simple patterns and the sustain pedal.&amp;nbsp; Odessa was wont to overuse the sustain pedal, but out here in the forest, she intended to indulge this guilty pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“May I play the piano on my own?”&amp;nbsp; Esmerelda asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Alright then,” her mother sighed.&amp;nbsp; “Sebastian, come here, you’ll have a turn after her.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian folded his arms and pouted.&amp;nbsp; His mother put her hand on his arm and gently guided him off the piano stool.&amp;nbsp; His sister revelled in her unfettered access, and her little hands eagerly explored the keyboard in search of new keys to jump on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian whined, “It’s not fair!” and tried to climb back up.&amp;nbsp; Esmerelda pushed him off the stool and recommenced playing.&amp;nbsp; Sebastian whined more loudly and sent his little fist into his sister’s back.&amp;nbsp; Within an instant both children were in tears.&amp;nbsp; Their mother looked at Odessa, pursed her lips, rolled her eyes, and sighed out of her nose.&amp;nbsp; “This is my life,” she said, “at least I’m never short of drama.”&amp;nbsp; She and her husband took the crying children off to the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trousers jumped up on top of the piano and reclined above the middle of the keys.&amp;nbsp; Odessa sat down at the piano and played an upbeat, simple waltz; she bobbed her head a little and pulsed to the beat through her shoulders.&amp;nbsp; Esmerelda stopped crying and her parents allowed her to approach the piano.&amp;nbsp; Odessa noticed the girl mimicking her movements .&amp;nbsp; Her brother continued to protest: “No, it’s not fair, I wanna play!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Sebastian, if you don’t calm down and let this woman play in peace we’ll go home and you shan’t get to play the piano at all,” his father said in hushed tones.&amp;nbsp; Sebastian’s cries geared down to a steady sob.&amp;nbsp; “No, I wanna play it on my own!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mother mouthed an apology to Odessa; Odessa smiled and shrugged.&amp;nbsp; With only a couple of slips, which the casual listener never notices anyway, Odessa finished the song with a delighted trill.&amp;nbsp; Esmerelda giggled and clapped her hands.&amp;nbsp; Odessa turned to her and bowed her head.&amp;nbsp; Sebastian’s father continued to reason with him in vain: “Come on now, let’s listen to this woman play, she’s very good, isn’t she?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian’s mother, embarrassed by her son’s behaviour, asked Odessa to play another song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa placed her hands on the keyboard and stopped. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What’s the matter?” Trousers asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I wish that little boy would stop making such a noise.&amp;nbsp; I haven’t had a chance to play for such a long time, and now that I’ve got this beautiful piano, I can’t play it in peace.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Maybe the boy is thinking along the same lines,” Trousers replied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa was a little annoyed that Trousers did not commiserate with her, and turned around to look at Sebastian.&amp;nbsp; He looked dejectedly at her with tears in his eyes.&amp;nbsp; She turned to Emerelda, whose excited grin had been replaced with an embarrassed frown when she had turned to see her brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I wonder if there’s something I can do,” Odessa said to herself.&amp;nbsp; “Would you like to play with me, Esmerelda?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Esmerelda nodded cautiously while looking at her mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Oh you don’t need to do that, I’m sure she’ll keep quiet,” the mother said to Odessa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This next song needs a partner, maybe even two,” she replied with a conspiratorial smile.&amp;nbsp; The mother took a moment to register Odessa’s meaning and her face lit up.&amp;nbsp; “Oh, I see, yes, that’s a good idea.”&amp;nbsp; Odessa directed Esmerelda to sit on the right side of the seat.&amp;nbsp; She gave Esmerelda a simple treble pattern to play over and over, and then layered a progression of arpeggios and chords over it with the middle keys.&amp;nbsp; They played for a few bars and Esmerelda squealed, “Look, Mummy, I’m playing a tune!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Well done, Esmerelda, that’s wonderful!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian stopped crying and walked up to the piano.&amp;nbsp; “Daddy, may I play too?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa nodded to the father and brought her ditty with Esmerelda to a close.&amp;nbsp; “That was grand, Esmerelda!” Odessa said, “Could you do that again?”&amp;nbsp; She nodded excitedly.&amp;nbsp; “Alright, now just wait a moment…”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She directed Sebastian to sit on her left and gave him a simple walking bass line in the same key as his sister’s treble pattern.&amp;nbsp; After a few attempts he got used to it.&amp;nbsp; “That’s it, Sebastian, keep on doing that; Esmerelda, repeat what you played for me...” After a bit of correction and encouragement, Sebastian and Esmerelda fell into the same rhythm.&amp;nbsp; Odessa proceeded to layer chords, arpeggios, trills, and other combinations between Sebastian’s bass line and Esmerelda’s treble pattern.&amp;nbsp; The two children concentrated quietly on their respective tasks and their parents held hands in breathless silence.&amp;nbsp; In a clearing in a forest in a garden in the sky, Odessa and her small companions made simple, happy music.&amp;nbsp; When the song had run its course, she placed her right hand on Esmerelda’s hands; the treble fell away; she placed her left hand on Sebastian’s hands; the bassline fell away; she played a final flourish and finished on a major chord.&amp;nbsp; The clearing hushed.&amp;nbsp; Odessa turned around and the parents clapped and shouted, “Bravo! Bravo! That was wonderful!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa directed her fellow players to stand up with her; they faced their audience hand in hand and took a bow.&amp;nbsp; She then placed Sebastian’s hand in Esmerelda’s and led them to their parents.&amp;nbsp; “Oh, that was marvellous,” the mother gushed.&amp;nbsp; “Thank you ever so much for putting up with them.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“All I did was listen to what they were trying to say.&amp;nbsp; They wanted to make music and I showed them how they could do it together.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Tell me,” the father interjected, “are you a professional musician?&amp;nbsp; You could make a good money doing that sort of thing.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I can perform in front of a crowd, but I never had the discipline to master the piano.&amp;nbsp; I always liked to try lots of different things.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Well then,” he replied, “you must be very talented.&amp;nbsp; I could have been pretty good at the piano myself, but I focused on other things too, and now that we have a family, it’s hard to find the time.&amp;nbsp; Isn’t that right, darling?”&amp;nbsp; She nodded with an expression of weary sagacity on her face.&amp;nbsp; “Yes, it all changes when you have children.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The family walked away hand in hand and Odessa sat back down at the piano.&amp;nbsp; Trousers hopped up on her lap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I tried to explain to them that I wasn’t putting up with the children, but rather listening to them.&amp;nbsp; Do you think they understood me, Trousers?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I suspect they listened to you as carefully as they do to their children.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“In that case, I think they can expect a lot more drama in their lives.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I’m afraid so.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa gave Trousers a quick scratch behind the ears and concentrated on the piano.&amp;nbsp; She ran through her modest repertoire, stumbling here and there, adding a little flourish of her own on occasion.&amp;nbsp; Although she enjoyed performing acrobatics or theatre in front of a crowd, she found it harder to allow the music to take hold of her when she had an audience, at least a human one, that is.&amp;nbsp; When she finished playing, the birds chirped their applause and the trees around her whispered in approval.&amp;nbsp; By this time Trousers was snoozing contentedly on her lap, and it took her a while before she could bring herself to shift him.&amp;nbsp; Rousing a sleeping cat from one’s lap always takes time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They followed a path that took her to a patch of grass next to a stream.&amp;nbsp; She lay down and Trousers settled in the small of her back.&amp;nbsp; She drifted off, listening to the song of the breeze.</content>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: Arial;"&gt;"&lt;i&gt;And our sports shall be seen&lt;br /&gt;On the echoing green&lt;/i&gt;" -- William Blake&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, when a cat settles on your chest, gazing at you with his dreamy, half-closed eyes, he thinks of an eternally sun-kissed green.&amp;nbsp; An occasional breeze caresses your face and dances through your hair.&amp;nbsp; The air is alive with chirps, buzzes, hums, and the fluttering of butterflies and ladybugs.&amp;nbsp; The grass is lush and soft; the trees, which are perfect for climbing, burgeon with ripe fruit of every kind. And the air is perfumed by daffodils, tulips, buttercups, and clusters of thornless roses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every cat will visit this green at some point; it's in his nature.&amp;nbsp; However, if he disappears, never to return, it is because he has been summoned to guide a traveller over The Crossings at the end of the green.&amp;nbsp; This is a great honour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The green gives way to a dusty, gravel track at the edge of an inky abyss that extends into the horizon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it is here that our story begins, when Odessa traversed the green and arrived at The Crossings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa came from a family of travellers. Although she was sad to leave her mother and father, brothers and sisters, she felt it had to be that way.&amp;nbsp; She also missed their travelling menagerie -- the musings of her cats, the chatter of her birds, the exclamations of her dogs, and even the anxious complaints of her guinea pigs.&amp;nbsp; From time to time, she inquired after her family from passing birds, and all the reports were that they were getting on well without her, but that they missed her all the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She wore soft, flat-soled boots, a pair of men’s cargo pants with a simple leather belt, a fitted T-shirt, and a lightweight long-sleeved top.&amp;nbsp; She carried all her belongings in a magical backpack, barely bigger than a pouch, that was infinitely bigger on the inside; no matter what you put in it, it was always weighed next to nothing.&lt;br /&gt;She had long tight black curls that cascaded over her shoulders and face and bobbled energetically.&amp;nbsp; When her dark oak brown eyes, set underneath a pair of bold black eyebrows, focused on you, you could almost feel the information being syphoned.&amp;nbsp; And when someone she especially loved held her close, she liked to purr softly and brush his cheek with hers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there was no-one that she especially loved anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunlight drained away as Odessa stepped on to the gravel path; a cruel wind cut through her clothes, its tendrils at her throat, face, and ears.&amp;nbsp; During her approach, the abyss had crept up into the sky; now the green, barely an arm's length away, seemed a mirage.&amp;nbsp; She put on a long jacket, a small silk scarf, and a pair of gloves from her backpack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All along the precipice is a row of wrought iron archways.&amp;nbsp; Through each archway is a broad gangplank, hovering in mid-air, that leads to a glowing white hanging bridge, suspended from nothing.&amp;nbsp; Some of the bridges disappear into the sky, some into the abyss, some straight ahead.&amp;nbsp; At the beginning of every bridge is a Victorian street lamp that shines with a faintly blue white light, to which is attached a white sign with a number in black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A well proportioned ginger tomcat stepped into the light of a torch that was fixed to a nearby archway.&amp;nbsp; His fur was divided into neat patchwork squares, some ginger, some auburn, some brown, and his four white paws looked like dainty gloves.&amp;nbsp; His hind quarters were very fluffy, which gave them the appearance of billowing trousers from behind.&amp;nbsp; He sat down somewhat officiously and looked up at her with bright hazel eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Oh what a lovely kitty!" She exclaimed.&amp;nbsp; "I wonder where you came from."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"My name is Praetorius Pathfinder XII," he replied in Queen's English, "but my daily name is Trousers.&amp;nbsp; I am your guide."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa's eyes widened with delighted curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"What kind of a cat are you?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Praetorius's chest puffed up with pride.&amp;nbsp; "I come from an old adventuring family.&amp;nbsp; Every first-born tomcat in my family for eleven generations -- ahem, that is, now twelve generations," he corrected himself, and seemed to swell even further, "every tomcat in my family has received a summons to guide a traveller over The Crossings."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa didn't understand the significance of Praetorius's lineage, but she could see that he held great store by this fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Why do they call you Trousers?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No sooner had she asked, than he had stood up and displayed his voluminous hindquarters, arching his back and reaching out with his front paws in order to emphasise their length and shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Oh, I see.&amp;nbsp; You do look very elegant."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Much obliged."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Well then, I think I'll call you Trousers if you don't mind."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I don't mind at all."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa regarded his sleek, patchwork-pattern coat, his fine bushy tail, his shapely ears, and his agile, dignified comportment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I must say, you are a handsome cat."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trousers licked the top of his front left paw and then used it to pat down a tuft of fur on his head.&amp;nbsp; He was particular about his appearance, and although he was never surprised to receive such compliments -- he being a well proportioned ginger tomcat, after all -- he was pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Trousers, where are we?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"We are at The Crossings.&amp;nbsp; It is time for you to choose a bridge."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Are you sure?" Odessa asked, "can't I just turn around and go back?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I have been summoned," he replied with an air of finality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They stood in silence for a while before Odessa spoke:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"But there are so many bridges -- "&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;" -- one-hundred-and-eighty-one to be precise -- "&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Yes, but which shall I choose?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"According to my summons, your first destination is the Man in the Mountain.&amp;nbsp; After that, we shall have to work it out together."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"What do you mean, my first destination?&amp;nbsp; Can't I just come back afterwards?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"You can only cross each bridge once, and every bridge takes you to a different place."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa frowned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I'm not sure that I want to cross any of these bridges.&amp;nbsp; Maybe I'll go back and play on the green instead.&amp;nbsp; Maybe I should just go home."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Why did you leave home?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She sighed.&amp;nbsp; There were many things she wanted to say, but thinking about it made her feel tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"It was time to go," she said simply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"And why did you leave the green?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa was not sure about that.&amp;nbsp; When she first got to the green, she thought she would never leave, but after a while she started wishing she had someone to purr and cuddle with.&amp;nbsp; The more she thought about that, the more she had felt drawn to the ugly darkness on the horizon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I was looking for someone," she began to say, "and now that I've met you we can return to the green together! Yes, you're what I need -- let's go back to the green!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trousers sat back down in silence.&amp;nbsp; His bushy tail tapped the ground behind him a couple of times and then lay flat.&amp;nbsp; He waited for her to continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Odessa hesitated.&amp;nbsp; She didn't like to admit that she was afraid, but the prospect of not getting back home had knocked her off kilter.&amp;nbsp; She turned to the green, so distant now it seemed, and then sat down on the gravel with her legs crossed.&amp;nbsp; She shivered in the cold and hugged herself, feeling worn out and a little lonely.&amp;nbsp; Trousers came and curled up in her lap.&amp;nbsp; She stroked his head and his purr sounded like a cross between a bumblebee and a diesel engine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Trousers, I'm afraid," she whispered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He didn't like to admit that he wasn't as confident as he seemed, but he reminded himself that a courageous cat is an honest cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"So am I, Odessa," He muttered with his chin on her forearm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"But what shall I do?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"If you return to the green now, you will never find out what is on the other side; if you make your first Crossing, you will only get back to the green at the end of your journey.&amp;nbsp; But we can brave our fear together if we both accept it."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa gave him a gentle squeeze.&amp;nbsp; He felt like a plush hot water bottle, and his purrs sent warm waves into her belly.&amp;nbsp; He had always enjoyed being stroked and held, and found it difficult at times to remain sufficiently aloof.&amp;nbsp; At any rate, there were no other cats around to see him and he did feel less anxious about his formidable assignment.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; He rolled on to his back and allowed her to stroke his stomach as his head lay on her hip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"In that case," Odessa said finally, "I should like to make a Crossing.&amp;nbsp; Which bridge leads to the Man in the Mountain?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Bridge #90."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so Odessa followed Praetorius Pathfinder XII through the archway, walked the hovering gangplank, and stepped on to Bridge #90.&amp;nbsp; With every passing step, the wooden slat behind her burst into flames like a giant match, dissolved into ash and drifted down into the abyss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"There's no turning back now," Odessa said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I'm afraid not," he replied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Chapter X: The Council</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
Odessa’s scribbling was interrupted by a hubbub outside the front entrance.&amp;nbsp; Turgolga was followed into the front room by a procession of high ranking ogresses who together constituted the Council for Creation and Improvement (known generally as the Council), which oversaw all matters of chief importance in the city of Ogressia.&amp;nbsp; The chieftanship of the Council rotated between the hostesses of each meeting; from now until the next monthly meeting, Turgolga would sit at the head of the table.&lt;br /&gt;
All the ogresses adorned their corpulent frames with elaborate necklaces, beads, and bracelets; they stood at attention around the great stone table facing Turgolga, who began:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Esteemed members of the Council for Creation and Improvement, I call today’s meeting to order.&amp;nbsp; Let us begin with a call of present members:&lt;br /&gt;
“Thugherga?” – “Bellowblast!”&lt;br /&gt;
“Ragudda?” – “Blackheart!”&lt;br /&gt;
“Gaghregga?” – “Thunderstone!”&lt;br /&gt;
“Kuzrobbina?” – “Oxenrider!”&lt;br /&gt;
“Serarka?” – “Cannonfist!”&lt;br /&gt;
“Marghbartha?” – “Shadowback!”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“And I, Turgolga Roundbelly, chieftan of the Council for this moonspan, am of course present.&amp;nbsp; Before we begin, I have something to show the Council.&amp;nbsp; Odessa!”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Odessa approached the table.&amp;nbsp; The ogresses stared in astonishment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
–- “My goodness! What is the bizarre little creature?”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “It looks like a baby hobgoblin.”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “Uglier, I should say.”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “Is it dirty?”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “It doesn’t look dirty.”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “Turgolga wouldn't bring a dirty creature into her home.”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “Of course not.”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “Still, it looks nasty.”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “And skinny too.”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “Yes, eerily skinny.”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “Where did it come from?”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turgolga motioned for the Council to let her speak.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“This creature is called a ‘woman’ and I found her near the Old Entrance.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“The Old Entrance?”&lt;br /&gt;
“How did she get there?”&lt;br /&gt;
“It must have been magic!”&lt;br /&gt;
“Don’t touch her, she might give you scales!”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“She is harmless to touch, dear Council members.&amp;nbsp; She has trained as a performer: isn’t that right, Odessa?”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Yes, Turgolga.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
–- “Ooh, a performer!”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “We love a good performance.”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “What did you think of last night’s drum dance?”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “The young ogresses are getting better, but ogresses these days are far too skinny.”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “That’s what they said about us before we came of age.”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “I know, but they can’t move if they don’t have anything to move with.”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “Too true”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “It's almost as if they're worried about looking good for the ogresons.”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “Ha! Don't be ridiculous!”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “You always say the most outrageous things, Serarka.”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “Not as outrageous as some of the outfits those emaciated ogresses were wearing last night, Kuzrobbina.”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “I thought they were rather weak, if you ask me.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Council members, please! Let us sit down and let our little visitor perform for us.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The ogresses sat down heavily around the table.&amp;nbsp; Turgolga motioned for Odessa to climb up and put on a show.&amp;nbsp; Odessa hopped up nervously on to the table and looked around.&amp;nbsp; Even though Odessa stood comfortably above her spectators, she felt herself to be easily within their grasp.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She faced Turgolga and raised her arms out to her sides.&amp;nbsp; She clapped a slow steady beat with her hands and indicated that the spectators should follow suit.&amp;nbsp; The ogresses clapped along with her: “clap (two-three-four), clap (two-three-four), clap (two-three-four)...”&lt;br /&gt;
Odessa bent backwards into a bridge, kicked her legs up, and settled into a handstand.&amp;nbsp; The ogresses sighed appreciatively and continued their rhythmic clapping.&amp;nbsp; She walked rhythmically along the table on her hands, straddled her legs, and lowered her legs down to a seated straddle.&amp;nbsp; She closed her legs, rolled backwards into a candle, and popped up into a handstand, and came back on to her feet.&amp;nbsp; She stepped to the beat of the claps, twirling her hands and sweeping her upper body around.&lt;br /&gt;
She did a neat cartwheel off her left foot, then a neat cartwheel back off her right; a one-handed cartwheel, then another the other way; an aerial cartwheel (hands up neatly at the end), and then an aerial cartwheel the other way; a butterfly kick one way and then the other, and finally a butterfly twist, out of which she went into a spot turn, and corkscrewed down until she ended with her legs crossed facing Turgolga.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Marvellous! Marvellous!” Turgolga exclaimed.&amp;nbsp; The rest of the ogresses clapped enthusiastically.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
–- “What a clever little creature!”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “I’m too dignified to move like that these days, but I could do that in my day.”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “Oh yes, I too, before I chose my ogreman.”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “Yes, you can’t do anything with an ogreman around.”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “They never get anything right.”&lt;br /&gt;
–- “Nothing at all.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Odessa took a bow and hopped off the table.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Thank you, Odessa,” Turgolga announced, “now let us get down to business…”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tazagthrog appeared at the doorway, his head bowed, his hands placed over each other at the height of his bellybutton.&amp;nbsp; Turgolga motioned impatiently for him to come in and he quietly slipped past them into the kitchen.&amp;nbsp; “Always so noisy and slow, my ogreman Tazagthrog” Turgolga said and the others hummed in agreement.&amp;nbsp; “I don’t know why I granted him my presence, but I suppose he could be worse.&amp;nbsp; He’s almost not too stupid sometimes.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“He’s very lucky to be with you, Turgolga.”&lt;br /&gt;
“I know, Thugherga, but he makes me feel so unappreciated sometimes.”&lt;br /&gt;
“That’s how they are; try as you might, you can’t change them; you can only do your best to keep them in line.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A few minutes later, Tazagthrog appeared with a titanic platter of cooked meat and vegetables, and a plate so small that it barely covered the palm of his hand.&amp;nbsp; He placed the platter on the table, and surreptitiously deposited a tiny plate (by ogre standards) in front of Odessa before whisking out.&amp;nbsp; The ogresses pounced on the platter and devoured its contents, shovelling great handfuls of meat and vegetables into their mouths with much grunting and burping and smacking of lips.&amp;nbsp; They washed their food with cupfuls of ogre wine and beer, and within a short while the entire platter had been picked clean.&amp;nbsp; Odessa could barely move after eating her portion of meat and vegetables&amp;nbsp; The ogresses sat back, not entirely satiated, and Turgola shouted to the entrance, “Tazagthrog, we need to talk!”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tazagthrog appeared at the doorway; Turgolga got up clumsily and walked into the kitchen.&amp;nbsp; Tazagthrog followed her in there and sounds of hitting and angry whispers emerged through the doorway: “Embarrass me in front of my guests… tiny portion… useless… pathetic… I don’t know why… well cook some more… you’ll just have to try harder next time…”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turgolga re-emerged from the kitchen and sat down at the table.&amp;nbsp; “I am terribly sorry for his incompetence.&amp;nbsp; He never gets it right.&amp;nbsp; I created the meal for him, but, yet again, he couldn’t make it properly.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes I think I should just make it myself.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
– “Don’t say that, Turgolga!”&lt;br /&gt;
– “You’re so patient with him.”&lt;br /&gt;
– “I don’t have such restraint with my Teggrut!”&lt;br /&gt;
– “Come now, it was a respectable appetiser.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mollified by the encouragement of her friends and the sight of their swollen bellies, Turgolga’s mood lightened and she commenced the meeting of the Council.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the rest of the day, the Council for Creation and Improvement discussed such matters as which ogreman was the most incompetent, whether beer or wine went best with ham, and whether ogres should be made to sleep outside the front door or in the square.&amp;nbsp; They also discussed Yugherkug’s impending Cleansing:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
– “Tomorrow’s the big day for your ogreson, isn’t it?”&lt;br /&gt;
– “It’s about time, ogresons are so ridiculous without a proper set of scales -- all those muscles showing through, it’s so indecent.”&lt;br /&gt;
– “And ogresons are so rowdy before their Cleansing”&lt;br /&gt;
– “Yes, it’s a shame they can’t be initiated at birth”&lt;br /&gt;
– “You’ve survived with him until now, what’s one more night?”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eventually, the Council for Creation and Improvement drew its meeting to a noisy close and the ogresses filed out of the Roundbelly home.&amp;nbsp; Tazagthrog speedily cleared the table and gathered the leftover food.&amp;nbsp; He left another minuscule portion (by his reckoning) near Odessa and glanced briefly at her.&amp;nbsp; When she smiled at him, he immediately dropped his gaze and disappeared into the kitchen.&amp;nbsp; A few moments later, he hurried past her and out the door with a handful of food.&amp;nbsp; Odessa heard the rustling of hay as he lay down for the night.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turgolga belched a few times, stood up unsteadily, and staggered to her bedroom.&amp;nbsp; She filled the doorframe with a perfectly sized obelisk and a few moments later, Odessa heard her crash into bed and start snoring.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Odessa walked to the front entrance and peered around the corner.&amp;nbsp; Tazagthrog lay still on his bed of hay, but as his eyes looked half-open, she wasn’t sure whether he was asleep.&amp;nbsp; A small ginger shape flashed past her and she turned around to see Trousers reclining on her backpack.&amp;nbsp; His bushy tail tapped her bag excitedly as he groomed his paws and stomach with energetic precision.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Trousers!” she whispered as she lay down next to him, “where were you?&amp;nbsp; Are you alright?”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trousers ceased his grooming and curled up in her arm, his face nestled under her chin.&amp;nbsp; “I have completed my scouting mission.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Odessa squeezed him with delight.&amp;nbsp; “Go on, what did you find out?”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trousers cleared his throat and commenced his report.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
Trousers worked his way up the rough stone wall of Turgolga’s house and climbed on to the thatched roof.&amp;nbsp; As the ogres’ dwellings were bunched together, he decided to explore the area by hopping across rooftops.&amp;nbsp; The adult ogres went mechanically about their day, carrying loads, breaking stones, building, repairing, cooking.&amp;nbsp; They moved with heavy deliberation and said very little.&amp;nbsp; Many of the ogres were accompanied by adolescent apprentices – a blacksmith banged away while his assistant pumped the bellows, two labourers, young and old, shuffled down the road with obelisks on their backs, a butcher slaughtered gigantic livestock while his assistant held them down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through the windows of some of the houses, Trousers saw groups of ogresses sitting in circles, talking animatedly, waving their arms and slapping their enormous thighs.&amp;nbsp; Here and there, little ogresons ran between houses and bounced around the open spaces; and young ogresses walked around in small groups, or sat in circles talking loudly at each other and slapping their trim thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the edge of the quarry a wide, dimly lit tunnel.&amp;nbsp; Trousers slipped behind some rocks near the entrance and peeked inside.&amp;nbsp; There was an inviting light in the distance.&amp;nbsp; He slipped inside and kept close to the walls.&amp;nbsp; Ogres transporting goods in clomped past those on their way out; no-one took any notice of Trousers as he sneaked through the shadows.&amp;nbsp; He emerged into the fresh air and made his way through the grass to a tall tree, scampered up its trunk, and surveyed the land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tunnel into the ogres’ city was halfway up a mountain, at the foot of which lay a sprawling, green, cultivated plateau.&amp;nbsp; Far into the horizon stretched neatly divided plots of land, some blanketed with crops, some filled with orchards, some covered with lush grass and populated by livestock.&amp;nbsp; Ogres trundled to and fro, working the land, carrying baskets of produce, and herding animals.&amp;nbsp; Some lay in the hot sun and snoozed, others sat on their haunches and quietly ate fistfuls of fresh food.&amp;nbsp; Trousers noticed that few of them talked to each other, and none of them sang.&amp;nbsp; An ogre came by and sat back against the trunk of Trousers' tree.&amp;nbsp; As there was nothing nearby for Trousers to jump on to, he paced carefully along the lower branches and got ready to scamper down the trunk behind the ogre's back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Take your time, I’ve come here for a nap,” the ogre said sleepily, looking ahead into the distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trousers froze.&amp;nbsp; The ogre turned around and looked up at him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Hello, little thing.” the ogre said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Hello,” Trousers replied cautiously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Tazagthrog and I belong to Turgolga.&amp;nbsp; What's your name and whom do you belong to?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“My name is Trousers and I don't belong to anyone.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I see, you haven't been selected by anyone yet.&amp;nbsp; Nice to meet you, Trousers.”&amp;nbsp; Tazagthrog settled back against the tree and stared into the distance.&amp;nbsp; “Feel free to come down, but don’t let the others see you -- they might want to play with you.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I’ll stay here for a while, if you don’t mind.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I don’t mind at all.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trousers climbed up a little higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What sort of creature are you, Trousers?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I’m a cat.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“And what does a cat do?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We do lots of things.&amp;nbsp; Some of us hunt mice and rats -- “&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What are mice and rats?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“They’re little furry creatures --”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“ -- even smaller than you?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Yes, even smaller than we are.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“How strange.&amp;nbsp; What else do you do?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Some of us own people -- “&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Is that creature you came with one of them?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Yes, she’s a person.&amp;nbsp; A young woman to be precise.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“And what do you do with your people?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We don’t have to do very much with them, they’re usually very well behaved.&amp;nbsp; They bring us food and drink, and build houses for us, and set aside places for us to sleep, and are always happy to see us.&amp;nbsp; We put up with them and allow them to rub our bellies and that spot just above our tails which always feels splendid.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“How do you acquire people?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Sometimes they are arranged for us before we are born; sometimes we have to scout out a suitable family and scratch at their door for a while.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Does that woman you came with belong to you?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“In a way she does.&amp;nbsp; I received a summons to be her guide, so I have to watch out for her.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tazagthrog closed his eyes and Trousers watched him suspiciously from the top of the tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Would you like to see something I made?”&amp;nbsp; Tazagthrog asked suddenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Where?&amp;nbsp; Here?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“No, over there,” Tazagthrog replied, pointing to a hill rising up from a forest in the distance.&amp;nbsp; “I keep ‘em in there.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I’m really not sure,” Trousers began, but Tazagthrog reached up to the branches and shook them.&amp;nbsp; The entire tree rocked as if in an earthquake, and Trousers dropped into Tazagthrog’s basket-like hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Well, if you insist…” Trousers said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tazagthrog marched across the grass into the trees.&amp;nbsp; They arrived at a large boulder at the foot of the hill.&amp;nbsp; He shifted the boulder aside to reveal a tall, narrow tunnel, and took Trousers into the spacious cave at its end.&amp;nbsp; The cave contained a catacomb filled with clay jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tazagthrog carefully extracted a few jars from the wall, each sealed with a neatly trimmed piece of leather that was secured with a string.&amp;nbsp; He held Trousers out in front of him and stared imposingly.&amp;nbsp; “You won’t run away.&amp;nbsp; Promise?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I promise.”&amp;nbsp; Tazagthrog put Trousers in one of the sections of the wall, up high.&amp;nbsp; Intrigued, Trousers watched as Tazagthrog undid the strings, removed the covers, and extracted a collection of animal-skin parchments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What are those, Tazagthrog?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“These are my, ah… I don’t actually know what to call them, but I made ‘em,”&amp;nbsp; Tazagthrog replied bashfully.&amp;nbsp; He squatted down, unrolled the parchments and laid them on the ground with polished stones on their corners to keep them flat.&amp;nbsp; On each parchment was an exquisite sketch in black ink -- the landscape, a view of the city from up high, the face of a pretty young ogress with long braided hair and a cheeky grin, and a row of burning wooden crosses in the middle of an open space.&amp;nbsp; Each sketch had a crude, almost childlike quality to it, but there was no doubting the skill or care of the artist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Did you draw these?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Ah… well… yes.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“These are fine sketches!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Sketches?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Yes, that’s what they are, aren’t they?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I don’t know.&amp;nbsp; I’ve never talked to anyone about them before.&amp;nbsp; I didn’t know they had a name.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“So who taught you how to do this?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I discovered this place it already had lots of these.&amp;nbsp; It was smaller when I found it, but I ran out of space, so I widened it.&amp;nbsp; There were more of these, ah, sketches (his mouth rolled around the word carefully), and they're much better than my ones.&amp;nbsp; Also, I didn't know how to make the special black paint.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You mean the ink?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Yes, ink,” he said carefully, “sketch, ink, sketch, ink...” he murmured to himself.&amp;nbsp; “I worked in the coal mines so I can make a lot of... ink – “ Tazagthrog pointed to a large mound of black coal, “and when Megork Granitegut disappeared, I took over from him in tanning the leather, so I could make more of these special skins.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Do you mean parchments?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“So that's what they're called! You are very clever.&amp;nbsp; How do you know all these names?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Where I come from, many people do what you do.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Really? Are they allowed to?&amp;nbsp; Don't they get in trouble?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Not usually.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“But they must be punished.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It might happen, if someone important gets upset about a sketch – it has happened before.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I thought so!&amp;nbsp; Do they have to face the Council?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What do you mean?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“If you do something wrong, you have to face the Council.&amp;nbsp; No-one wants to face the Council.”&amp;nbsp; Tazagthrog shuddered briefly as he stared into the distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were silent for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Why did your friend disappear?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What's a friend?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trousers opened his mouth to reply, but stopped himself and thought carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Are there any other ogres who know about this place?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I don't think so.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Does that mean you haven't told anyone else about it?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I'm not supposed to be here.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Is there no other ogre you can show this place to?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I'm not supposed to be here.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What would happen if another ogre found you here?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Oh,” Tazagthrog's shoulders slumped, “I would have to face the Council.&amp;nbsp; You won't tell anyone, will you?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Of course not!” Trousers still didn't fancy his chances of escaping the cave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tazagthrog looked up at Trousers.&amp;nbsp; “What's a friend?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trousers considered his reply.&amp;nbsp; “A friend is someone you can tell a secret to, and he won't tell the Council.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tazagthrog stared intently at the floor.&amp;nbsp; “Does that mean you're my friend?”&amp;nbsp; He asked quietly.&amp;nbsp; Trousers paused and Tazagthrog looked up from the floor at him with wide open eyes and bated breath.&amp;nbsp; In that moment Trousers felt himself to be staring down at Tazagthrog from an imperious distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Yes, Tazagthrog, you could say we are,” Trousers replied reassuringly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Tazagthrog allowed the response to sink in, a warm smile spread across his rough face.&amp;nbsp; He returned to his sketches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“D'you like 'em?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“They're superb! Tell me, why did the other ogre disappear?&amp;nbsp; Where did he go to?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“No-one knows what happens to 'em.&amp;nbsp; I sometimes wish I could disappear too.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Why?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes wonder if there isn’t something better, and besides, I don’t really count for much, no-one would miss me.&amp;nbsp; But then again, what could be better than having food to eat, and hay to sleep on, and an ogress to belong to?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Tell me more about these sketches, please,” he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tazagthrog pointed to the landscape.&amp;nbsp; “This is my first, ah, sketch.&amp;nbsp; One of the goats strayed from the flock and I went up the hill to find him.&amp;nbsp; When I looked at the land from the top of the hill, it made me, ah…” Tazagthrog looked around the floor as if he lost something.&amp;nbsp; “It made me feel as if I’d eaten a big feast, only without food.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Do you mean to say it made you feel happy?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What does that mean?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I suppose you could say it’s when you are neither hungry nor thirsty, neither angry nor in pain; when all the things that bother you fade away and everything else feels good.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Yes! When I stood there looking at the land from the top of the hill, I didn't want to hurt or kill anyone, or even break anything.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Are you saying it felt even better than hunting?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tazagthrog sat down with his legs crossed and pondered this question.&amp;nbsp; “Better than hunting?&amp;nbsp; I don't know.&amp;nbsp; I always thought that hunting was the best.&amp;nbsp; It was different.&amp;nbsp; Hunting in the Dome is what we all dream of; but no-one ever talks about this quiet feeling.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“And so you sketched the scene that made you feel happy, right?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Yes, happy,” He said slowly.&amp;nbsp; “And whenever I look at it, I feel that feeling again.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“That means it's the best kind of sketch, Tazagthrog.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tazagthrog smiled with embarrassment, rolled up the parchment, and put it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What about the sketch of the ogress?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“That’s Turgolga,” Tazagthrog said with a wistful smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Is that when she was younger?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Yes, the day I become hers.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“She seemed lovely.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Yes, she’s perfect.&amp;nbsp; I don’t know why she chose me.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Why don’t you show her this?&amp;nbsp; I’m sure she’d love to see it.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I’m not supposed to be here.”&amp;nbsp; Tazagthrog rolled up the parchment and put it away too.&amp;nbsp; He made to roll up the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Your sketch of the city is incredible!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tazagthrog stopped and looked up at Trousers with a proud smile.&amp;nbsp; He sat back down next to his sketch.&amp;nbsp; “Thank you.&amp;nbsp; It took me a long time.&amp;nbsp; It's the view from the top of the stairs to the Old Entrance.&amp;nbsp; I like going there.&amp;nbsp; It’s quiet there.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I know what you mean.&amp;nbsp; Before I left my home I had a place that I liked to go to.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes I would sit and think; sometimes I’d just sit.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Yes, I sit here and think too,” Tazagthrog replied half to himself.&amp;nbsp; He looked up.&amp;nbsp; “Do friends sit and think together?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Yes, we certainly do.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes that’s the best thing friends can do.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You’re a good friend then, little Trousers.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You're a good friend too, Tazagthrog.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Chapter IV: Trousers and Waistcoat</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="272" mozallowfullscreen="" msallowfullscreen="" oallowfullscreen="" src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/schristia/2709118040/player/0b0d2af17f" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="500"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Trousers woke up from his nap and shambled off Odessa’s back.&amp;nbsp; He yawned and stretched. Odessa stirred in her sleep and turned on to her side.&amp;nbsp; Trousers helped himself to a quick nuzzle of her nape.&amp;nbsp; “Let’s go exploring,” he said to himself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He made his way back to the piano and took the third path from the clearing.&amp;nbsp; It meandered through the garden, up the hills, and through a maze.&amp;nbsp; At the centre of the maze sat a life-sized statue of a cat on top of a brick wall.&amp;nbsp; As Trousers approached it, the grey stone skin melted away and the statue came to life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Welcome, young Trousers, we have much to talk about.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trousers sat before the venerable ginger tabby.&amp;nbsp; He had long white whiskers and the fur from his midriff to his shoulders was pitch black.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Who are you?”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“I am Praetorius Pathfinder, but my daily name is Waistcoat.&amp;nbsp; Congratulations on receiving your summons.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Pathfinder Waistcoat?&amp;nbsp; As in Praetorius Pathfinder the First, who travelled with Gudrid the Viking across the frozen ocean to the New World?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Yes, I am he.&amp;nbsp; After Gudrid settled in the New World, I received a second summons to accompany Lusita the Light Bringer.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Is it true that you guided Lusita through the Dark Valley of the giant black wolves?”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“We helped each other get through, it is probably fairer to say.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"What did you find on the other side?" &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"We found a gate in the rock that lead to a path through the Black Forest, past a clearing, to the bridge that leads to this garden in the clouds."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Are the stories about the giant black wolves true?&amp;nbsp; How did you make it through?”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Lusita’s willingness to step out of the shadows had more to do with our survival than we in the feline world give her credit for.&amp;nbsp; But that’s a story for another time."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"Will you ever return to your old family?"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"Not unless I receive a new summons, but I have already answered two.&amp;nbsp; And besides, many generations have passed since then.&amp;nbsp; I like to keep an eye on their descendants from here though.&amp;nbsp; I’m pleased to see that they haven’t gone in for this fashion of owning fluffy little dogs -- I can’t take those walking bathmats seriously."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"Don't you miss them?"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"Of course I do, but my place is here now.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trousers sighed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“I wish I could be as brave as you.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Oh, Trousers,” he laughed, “you make it sound terribly grand.&amp;nbsp; To be honest I was often freezing and terrified; most of the time I had no idea whither to go or what to do!”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trousers stared at his paws.&amp;nbsp; “Then you know how I feel.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Tell me more.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trousers scratched the ground in front of him and looked to the side.&amp;nbsp; “I’m not sure I am up to this task, Grandfather Waistcoat.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“But, my dear cat, you have been summoned; and you’re a Pathfinder, no less.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Maybe there was a mistake, maybe I was supposed to remain a house cat.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“A summons is never issued by mistake.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“I know, that’s what Grandfather Buttons always said.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Ah yes, Praetorius the Tenth.&amp;nbsp; He had a very dapper set of black spots on his belly, but he had his moments.&amp;nbsp; Do you know that when he lead Peregrin the Pilgrim over The Crossings he nearly fell off the bridge?”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trousers stared at his ancestor in amazement.&amp;nbsp; Waistcoat sauntered along the brick wall, pretending to nervously cross a bridge, looking back and veering off to the side until he allowed himself to drop off the edge.&amp;nbsp; Trousers burst out laughing and they both giggled like kittens.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“I thought I was the only one that could happen to!” Trousers exclaimed between fits of laughter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“So did I,” Waistcoat replied mirthfully as he rolled on the ground and pretended to fall through the air.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trousers laughed anew at Waistcoat’s antics and they both jumped up on and dropped off the fence, allowing themselves to fall over when they hit the ground.&amp;nbsp; After a final round of laughter, they both returned to their dignified sitting.&amp;nbsp; Waistcoat stretched and Trousers followed his lead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Don’t be ashamed to nuzzle Odessa and purr into her chest, or be stroked and held by her.&amp;nbsp; You two will be together for a long time.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“I always thought that a cat is supposed to be more dignified than that.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Humbug!&amp;nbsp; Once you receive your summons, helping your traveller is supreme.&amp;nbsp; None of us had the foggiest idea what we were supposed to do, but if there is one thing I learned from my travels, and from watching those who went before you, it is that Odessa will need your love, counsel, and protection more than anything else.&amp;nbsp; There will be times, young Trousers, when you feel like nothing more than a carry-on kitty, but always remember that you were summoned for a reason.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Praetorius Pathfinder the First returned to his original position, closed his eyes, and turned back into stone.&amp;nbsp; Trousers rubbed his head against the statue and he went on his way.</content>

    <content type='html'>Thank you! I&amp;#39;m very pleased you enjoy the descriptions.  I have a lot of ideas and there are general themes I wish to explore, but I expect the story to take shape over the next few months.  I&amp;#39;m getting a better sense of who Odessa is and what her function in the story will be, but I need to give it time.  You&amp;#39;ll get to see a lot more over the coming chapters.</content>

&lt;br /&gt;
The Odessia was started as a group endeavour and shall forever be so.&amp;nbsp; As I said back in my introductory post &lt;a href="http://theodessia.blogspot.com.au/2014/01/creative-commons-free-culture-and-dream.html" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons, Free Culture, and A Modest Dream&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
It is my heart's desire that some of you who enjoy these stories will 
use these ideas and my imagery for your own creations.&amp;nbsp; If we all link

create a template for the blog, for example), your music, your audio 
production talent -- I will record readings --, your voice acting,&amp;nbsp; your
 video production, your animation, your acting on camera, your live 
performance, your translations, your editing, your own writing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
To this end, the following is a wishlist of contributions that would go a long way towards realizing this dream.&amp;nbsp; If you think of something else you'd like to do, please get in touch with me via the Contact Form, Google+, or the Facebook page!&lt;br /&gt;

Shows kindness to someone; evokes the ire of the village -- plants a seed that life need not be this way.</content>

    <title>Sketches of Odessa by Ann M. Tedeschi-Davidson</title>

    <content type='html'>Xetoil, thank you very much for your comments!
I have amended Odessa&amp;#39;s physical description and a few other details.  Please let me know what you think!

For comparison&amp;#39;s sake, here is the original description:

She wore soft, flat-soled boots, cargo pants with a simple leather belt, a fitted T-shirt, and a lightweight long-sleeved top with the sleeves usually rolled up.  She carried her belongings in a spacious backpack, with lots of pockets and compartments.  Her long tight black curls cascaded over her shoulders and bobbled energetically when she moved.  Her eyes were the colour of dark oak and were set underneath a pair of bold black eyebrows; she had a habit of scanning every detail.  When she focused her attention on you, you could almost feel the information being syphoned.  When she daydreamed, which she did often, she tended to tilt her head to one side and look up out of the corner of her left eye with slightly parted lips.  And when someone she especially loved held her close, she liked to purr softly, sometimes with a French R, sometimes trilled, and brush his cheek with hers.</content>

&lt;br /&gt;
First of all, many thanks to the people who have given me feedback and shared Odessa's first adventure, The Man in the Mountain. (&lt;a href="http://theodessia.blogspot.com/2013/12/chapter-ii-man-in-mountain.html" target="_blank"&gt;Chapter II&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://theodessia.blogspot.com/2014/01/chapter-ii-part-two-meeting-man.html" target="_blank"&gt;Chapter III&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Especial thanks to my friends Timotej Kovačič and Ann M. Tedeschi-Davidson; Timotej has been invaluable behind the scenes and Ann's sketches of Odessa are a real delight.&amp;nbsp; Remember, these stories are released under a Creative Commons licence, so if you feel a surge of creativity when reading them, you already have permission to use this material!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Chapters IV to X: In the Ogres' Lair&lt;/h2&gt;
Odessa's next adventure will take her to a dangerous, violent place, populated by enormous men and women.&amp;nbsp; However, by the end of her time there she will come to see that first impressions can be misleading.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Release Schedule&lt;/h2&gt;
For the next seven weeks a new chapter shall be released every Friday afternoon. (Australian time)&amp;nbsp; This will take us from Friday the 17th of January 2014 until the 28th of February 2014.&amp;nbsp; By that time I hope to have a new batch of chapters lined up, but as I have to balance this project with work and studies, I can't make any promises yet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Fear and Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
I am very new to writing with a view to publishing my work, and truth be told it is very frightening.&amp;nbsp; I am often beset by the fear that it's all clumsy rubbish; that no-one in his right mind would want to read it -- it's too long, too short, too predictable; it's contrived, unoriginal, uninteresting.&lt;br /&gt;
So I write and rewrite until there is nothing else I can do to make it better -- that's not to say I am satisfied with it, but I can only go so far under my own steam.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And this is where you can really help me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'd like to find an editor (anyone interested?) to review the stories before I publish them, but, either in addition to an editor or in place thereof, I'd like you, my readers to be my crowdsourced editors too.&amp;nbsp; Let me explain:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When I studied Shakespeare at university one of the most striking things that I learned about him was his method of writing; that is, he would change the script in response to feedback from the audience.&amp;nbsp; It is said that Shakespeare would watch the audience during the performance of his plays and take note of when they cheered and applauded and when they got bored or booed the players.&amp;nbsp; English audiences were very vocal back then.&amp;nbsp; If people liked certain dialogue or characters, Shakespeare worked more of that material into the play; if the audience didn't enjoy other parts, out they went.&amp;nbsp; This meant that the final version of the script could be radically different from when it was first performed; whether it had more artistic merit is debatable, but one thing was for sure: the audiences loved it, and I suspect that this is one reason for Shakespeare's enduring success.&amp;nbsp; He didn't have an elevated view of himself as an artiste; he had an incredible talent for telling stories, and had plenty of stories to tell -- or rather plagiarise by today's nauseating standards of copyright -- and did his utmost to write plays that communicated his ideas and kept people entertained.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What I mean by all this, to return to our little project here, is that I would love your feedback -- your encouragement of course, but especially your criticism.&amp;nbsp; What do you think of the characters?&amp;nbsp; What do you think of the descriptions?&amp;nbsp; Does the plot flow?&amp;nbsp; Does it stretch the suspension of disbelief?&amp;nbsp; What would you like to see more of?&amp;nbsp; What would you like to see less of?&amp;nbsp; How does reading this make you feel?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Wiki-style Editing&lt;/h2&gt;
Following this invitation to shower me with your feedback, understand that these chapters are not set in stone.&amp;nbsp; If, months or years from now, you discover this novel and think of something I could do better, even in Chapter I, I will still be open to revising it.&amp;nbsp; That's the beauty of an online novel -- there is no final draft that I have to submit to a publisher, no deadline, no word limit.&amp;nbsp; Naturally, with the passage of time there will be less and less need or justification to alter the earlier chapters, but that doesn't mean it'll ever be out of the question.&amp;nbsp; I hope that as Odessa's adventure unfolds, we'll all get a better sense of who she is and how she'll interact with the characters she meets.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For now, I hope you enjoy her adventure in the ogres' lair.</content>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Simpler, Faster Template &lt;/h2&gt;
Owing to problems with the Dynamic Template on blogger, I have switched 
to a simple standard template and a pretty background.  This change 
should make the blog load faster and also make it easier to read on 
mobile devices. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Gadgets galore! &lt;/h2&gt;
Also, I have added various gadgets to the blog including a donation button,
 subscription via RSS, subscription via email, an email contact form, 
and translation.  The translation to Hebrew is pretty rubbish, but to 
German, French, and Afrikaans seems passable.  You know what would be 
even better?  A translation from one of my readers &lt;br /&gt;
Let me know what you think.</content>

    <title>950 Hours: A new name, JavaScript and NodeJS</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
&lt;h3 style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SOHwWMEajPs/Wtajtz9_mwI/AAAAAAAAaAA/pgAfP_AwULwrSS8AojTkBDN3-7I7nl1EgCKgBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180418_113649.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" data-original-height="900" data-original-width="1600" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SOHwWMEajPs/Wtajtz9_mwI/AAAAAAAAaAA/pgAfP_AwULwrSS8AojTkBDN3-7I7nl1EgCKgBGAs/s320/IMG_20180418_113649.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;
Mission WebDev&lt;/h3&gt;
Mission DevOps is now Mission WebDev.&amp;nbsp; Nothing much else in the blog will change, but it represents the next stage in the evolution of my career as a software developer.&amp;nbsp; Since I updated my online profile to reflect this, I have attracted more interest, which is always a good sign.&amp;nbsp; I am working my way through a couple of courses online to lay a strong foundation for front-end development, so in this pomodoro cycle I have covered, inter alia, the following topics:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;
HTML/CSS/JavaScript&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basics of HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basics of CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basics of Bootstrap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basics of JavaScript:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control Flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basics of DOM Manipulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basics of jQuery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;
NodeJS (Mostly theoretical)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V8 JS Engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node core&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;modules, exports, require&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Events and the Event Emitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asynchronous code, libuv, event loop streams, files, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;
Study Goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
My goal for the next pomodoro cycle is to complete the following courses online:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/understand-nodejs" target="_blank"&gt;Learn and Understand NodeJS by Anthony Alicea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
It's not an easy course because Alicea goes deep into the Node core and takes the time to explain concepts in tremendous detail.&amp;nbsp; I'm taking lots of notes getting a lot of&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;gestalt&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;moments.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/learn/v4/overview" target="_blank"&gt;JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts by Anthony Alicea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
I'm so impressed by Alicea's treatment of NodeJS so far, that I trust his JavaScript course will give me the deep understanding I'm looking for.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp" target="_blank"&gt;The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
I'm finding it to be a great educational framework.&amp;nbsp; I've put it on hold until I complete the other two courses, and will probably park it in order to supplement my knowledge in other areas, but it's the best overall guide to becoming a web dev that I've found so far.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;
Coding Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
In addition to the course, I've set myself the challenge of working my way through last year's &lt;a href="http://adventofcode.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; in JavaScript.&amp;nbsp; If I can complete all these challenges, I'll be satisfied with my proficiency in JavaScript and be confident in mastering a web development framework.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;
React or Vue?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
I'm still undecided, but it's probably not something I'll have to address before I hit 1,000 (!!!) hours in my mission to become a fully fledged (and employed) web developer.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
See you in a hundred pomodoros.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Chapter VI: The Cave in the Canyon</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Bridge #135 took Odessa and Praetorius Pathfinder XII (known to his friends as Trousers) down from the sky into the depths of a grand canyon.&amp;nbsp; They arrived at the opening of a cave high up in the wall of the sheer cliff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they stepped off, the final slat exploded in a rush and the rest of the bridge disintegrated in the morning sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa’s shadow stretched into the cave, but beyond the entrance it fell into darkness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa pulled out of her bag a pearl-coloured orb that fit comfortably in the palm of her hand.&amp;nbsp; It had been a birthday present from a strange old man who joined her family on their travels for a while.&amp;nbsp; When they set up their stalls and street performances, he walked around town chatting with people and somehow always convinced them to buy something or see a show.&amp;nbsp; He never rushed, yet he always got everything done.&amp;nbsp; He wore flowing clothes and had a long white beard; he was the only adult Odessa had met that could speak with her animals.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any adult can talk with animals, but somewhere along the way most adults forget how to listen, first to animals, then to children, then to each other, and finally to themselves.&amp;nbsp; Animals worked this out a long time ago, which is why dogs make lots of gestures and noises, and cats bring us dead birds; they find it hard to see how we adults can take care of ourselves when we have forgotten how to listen to our own bodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Odessa’s seventeenth birthday, the old man sat down with her and placed the orb in her hand.&amp;nbsp; “As long as you look with an open heart and think kind thoughts, the light of this orb will show you the way,” he said.&amp;nbsp; It now floated from the palm of her hand and hovered like a little lantern over her head; they left the sun-lit mouth of the cave and examined their surroundings in the light of the orb’s gentle white glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trousers sniffed the air suspiciously.&amp;nbsp; “I don’t like the smell of this place,” he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cave narrowed to a tall, broad tunnel.&amp;nbsp; There were animal bones strewn on the floor and and brown smears on the walls.&amp;nbsp; They reached a fork in the tunnel; they stood there, wondering which way to go, when they heard lumbering footsteps and the sound of bodies dragging on the ground coming from the tunnel to the right.&lt;br /&gt;They stepped into the tunnel to the left and looked back into the main tunnel.&amp;nbsp; The outline of a pair of giants came into view.&amp;nbsp; One dragged a collection of gargantuan sheep, goats, and cows behind him on a rope; the other carried a bundle of firewood under his arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Let’s have a one of these as a snack at the Old Entrance.”&amp;nbsp; The first giant said in a deep, slow, almost childlike voice.&lt;br /&gt;“Good idea, I’ bin bashin’ rock all through the night and I’m starvin’,” replied his friend, in a slightly less deep, but equally uninflected tone.&lt;br /&gt;“You ain’t starvin’, you fa’ oaf, you’re a greedy troll”&lt;br /&gt;“Who you callin’ a troll, you goblin!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the two giants continued walking, exchanging clumsy insults and pushing each other into the wall, which sent vibrations through the rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Trousers, what were those men?&amp;nbsp; I’ve never seen anyone so big in my life!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We are in the ogres’ lair.&amp;nbsp; My grandfather, Praetorius Pathfinder X (known to his friends as Buttons for the dots on his belly) passed through here once.&amp;nbsp; He said the ogres are very stupid, but if they get a hold of you, they think it good sport to use you as a plaything -- and they play very rough indeed.&amp;nbsp; He also said to beware of -- watch out!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And before Odessa could turn around, a pair of huge hands reached out of the shadows, grabbed her by the waist and lifted her high into the air.&amp;nbsp; Odessa’s vision was filled by a pair of huge yellow eyes and big yellow teeth.&amp;nbsp; Trousers scampered back into the entrance tunnel and watched helplessly as the ogress held Odessa aloft like a doll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You’re an ugly little creature,” the ogress said.&amp;nbsp; “You’re the boniest, skinniest thing I’ve seen.”&amp;nbsp; The ogress’s breath hit Odessa’s face like a sulfurous tropical wind; Odessa gagged and coughed as she tried to reply.&amp;nbsp; The ogress put Odessa back down and prodded her, sending her flying back into the entrance tunnel.&amp;nbsp; Odessa allowed her body to be carried by the force of the blow and when her feet made contact with the ground she dissipated the momentum with an agile safety roll back over her shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I’m sorry!” the ogress exclaimed, “I didn’t mean to hurt you.&amp;nbsp; You’re not broken, are you?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“That’s alright,” Odessa replied, dusting herself off.&amp;nbsp; “I’m used to being thrown around, it’s part of the act that I used to perform in.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You were in a show?&amp;nbsp; Could you show me more of your act?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I’d be happy to, but who were those two ogres who came by?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“They were a couple of rock workers; I saw them come up here and wanted to see what they were up to.&amp;nbsp; Now come back here before they grab you and decide to have you as a snack.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ogress wore a skirt and a top made of animal skin; she had vast legs like gelatinous tree trunks and a pot belly that her top barely concealed.&amp;nbsp; Her skin was the colour of mustard and her limbs were roadmapped with protruding veins.&amp;nbsp; She had wiry hair that went just past her ears.&amp;nbsp; Having got over her astonishment at her sheer size and strangeness, Odessa examined the ogress’s face more appreciatively.&amp;nbsp; Her face had a couple of moles and what looked like a wart on the tip of her nose; her teeth, though large and yellow, were quite straight.&amp;nbsp; Her big flat nose seemed about right for her round face, and her pointy ears stuck out of her hair in a way that, if nothing else, suited her features.&amp;nbsp; Her narrow eyes examined Odessa intelligently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What are you, little things?” The ogress asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“My name is Odessa.&amp;nbsp; I’m a girl, or a woman I suppose.&amp;nbsp; What’s your name?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I am Turgolga, chieftain of the Roundbelly clan.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“That sounds rather important.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Yes, we’re one of the leadings clans.&amp;nbsp; I’m also the head of the Council for Improvement and Creation,” Turgolga replied proudly.&amp;nbsp; “What’s that fuzzy thing you’ve got there?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“His name is Trousers.&amp;nbsp; He’s a cat.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Praetorius Pathfinder, actually, but you may call me Trousers if you like.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It looks like something that one of our animals might cough up.&amp;nbsp; Come to think of it, one of the old ogresses told me she had seen a furball like that once.&amp;nbsp; She had never seen anything move so fast -- she chased it, but it escaped to the Outside, and of course the ogres there lost track of it within minutes.&amp;nbsp; You can’t rely on them to get anything right.&amp;nbsp; I always wondered what it looked like.&amp;nbsp; Quite unimpressive, I’ll say; and very skinny.&amp;nbsp; He’d barely be worth cooking by the looks of it.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa picked up Trousers and held him protectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What are you doing here?” the Ogress asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We’re travellers; we came here on a white bridge.&amp;nbsp; We need to find another one to continue our journey.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We’ve never had a traveller arrive by the Old Entrance.&amp;nbsp; There was a bridge that lead here once, but that was generations ago.”&amp;nbsp; Turgolga strode towards Odessa.&amp;nbsp; Odessa thought of running away, but she didn’t fancy her chances of making it past Turgolga’s large, powerful hands or faring any better with the ogres at the Old Entrance.&amp;nbsp; Turgolga picked Odessa up again and sniffed her suspiciously. “I’m not sure what magic brought you here, but you seem harmless enough.”&amp;nbsp; She put Odessa back down and put her hands on her enormous hips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Tell me, what’s the difference between a girl and a woman?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It’s hard to say,” Odessa began, “but some people would say that when you’re a woman you’re too soft and delicate to run around and climb trees and wrestle with boys and build things and break things, but when you’re a girl you’re tough enough to do all those things.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“So does that mean you start as a woman and then grow into a girl?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Not exactly,” Odessa replied.&amp;nbsp; “It’s usually the other way around.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“How do you start tough and become soft?&amp;nbsp; I’ve never heard of such a thing.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa was about to reply that she herself was still trying to work it out, when the heavy footsteps of the returning ogres interrupted them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Quick, come with me,” Turgolga whispered, “I’ll take you home; you’ll be safe there.&amp;nbsp; And besides, I’d love to show you to the Council.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Will they eat us?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Not unless we vote unanimously to do so,” Turgolga replied without a hint of sarcasm, “and besides they’ll probably enjoy your performance -- we always enjoy a new performance.&amp;nbsp; Also, I’d like to hear more about why your little people get soft when they grow up.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Turgolga set off, Odessa took a ball of bright string from her bag and let it trail out behind her.&amp;nbsp; They followed Turgolga into a dizzying labyrinth of tunnels, sometimes turning left, sometimes turning right, sometimes going straight ahead.&amp;nbsp; The walls of the tunnels were illuminated at regular intervals with crafted torches and decorated with delicate tribal patterns and artwork.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“These tunnels are incredible,” Odessa whispered.&amp;nbsp; “Who created all this?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We did, of course.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You mean the ogres?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turgolga snorted with laughter.&amp;nbsp; “What? No! Ogres can’t create anything -- except for some primitive patterns, I suppose.&amp;nbsp; Everything here was created by the ogresses.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa was confused.&amp;nbsp; “Those ogres who walked by looked enormously strong.&amp;nbsp; Why didn’t they help you?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turgolga made a guttural snort . “Clearly, you can’t tell the difference between creating and making.&amp;nbsp; The ogres did the stupid work of digging and carving and hewing and carrying, but you need ogresses to create the idea.&amp;nbsp; If you left an ogre to his own devices he’d simply bash his head against the rock, or rather bash another ogre’s head against the rock.&amp;nbsp; If it weren’t for the ogresses to keep the ogres in check, we’d all be huddled on the Entrance, shivering in the wind.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I think I understand,” Odessa replied.&amp;nbsp; “It must be difficult to live with ogres if they’re as rough and thick as that.&amp;nbsp; I guess they’re a bit like some boys where I come from.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We do our best to keep them in check,” Turgolga sighed, “But life for an ogress was never meant to be easy.”&lt;br /&gt;

    <content type='html'>Thank you! To answer your question about this line:

&amp;quot;With only a couple of slips, which the casual listener never notices anyway, Odessa finished the song with a delighted [should that be &amp;quot;delightful&amp;quot;] trill?&amp;quot;

What I wanted to convey is that Odessa took delight in finishing the song with a trill, i.e. &amp;quot;delighted&amp;quot;.  Odessa is not an accomplished pianist, so her judgement as to the use of the trill might not be perfect, but she really likes adding it when she can.  I suppose it&amp;#39;s like a guitarist who likes to slide or hammer, even if the music doesn&amp;#39;t always call for those techniques...

By contrast, a trill is either *delightful* if it is played at the right time and executed properly, or it is *not delightful* if it&amp;#39;s poorly timed or executed.

So I think &amp;quot;delighted&amp;quot; conveys the meaning, but it&amp;#39;s a great question nevertheless.</content>

Tazagthrog stirred and sat up.&amp;nbsp; “What happened?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trousers looked up at Tazagthrog.&amp;nbsp; His skin glowed a gentle yellow in the moonlight and his amber eyes were now a delicate jasmine green.&amp;nbsp; “She reached out to you.&amp;nbsp; She wanted to share your pain.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tazagthrog’s face fell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I’m sorry,” he said.&amp;nbsp; “There was a lot of pain to share.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He reached over and cupped Odessa’s body in his hands and held her over his lap.&amp;nbsp; He closed his eyes and filled the cave with a mournful groaning hum.&amp;nbsp; Trousers climbed up on to Tazagthrog and curled up on Odessa’s chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The melody of Tazagthrog's hums was broken by an angry shout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Tazagthrog! What are you doing! Have you gone completely out of your mind?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He opened his eyes.&amp;nbsp; Turgolga emerged from the back of the cave and stared at him in astonishment.&amp;nbsp; Tazagthrog put Odessa and Trousers down and stood up to face her.&amp;nbsp; She gasped when she saw his exposed body, his bulging muscles, his electric blue scars, his jasmine green eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Tazagthrog, look at you!&amp;nbsp; Where are your scales?&amp;nbsp; Who did this to you?&amp;nbsp; You look ridiculous!&amp;nbsp; How are we supposed to go back home with you looking like this?&amp;nbsp; What will the Council think?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tazagthrog smiled and met her gaze.&amp;nbsp; Her slanted yellow eyes widened and her nostrils flared at the insult.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tazagthrog replied calmly, “Do&amp;nbsp; you remember that time in the square, Turgolga?&amp;nbsp; That time when I stepped into your space?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She hesitated.&amp;nbsp; “All those years ago?&amp;nbsp; Yes, you nearly crashed into me; it was only sheer luck that I missed your ears when I hit you.&amp;nbsp; What’s that got to do with this?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I don’t think you wanted to hit my ears.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She paused.&amp;nbsp; “Maybe I didn’t, so what then?&amp;nbsp; What are we going to do with you?&amp;nbsp; How could you do this to me?&amp;nbsp; Who ever heard of an ogre without scales?&amp;nbsp; And look at your eyes!&amp;nbsp; They’re like a&amp;nbsp; ogreson’s!&amp;nbsp; Did she do this to you?&amp;nbsp; I knew I should have squashed her the moment I saw her!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turgolga advanced on Odessa and Trousers, but Tazagthrog stepped in front of them.&amp;nbsp; “No, Turgolga, let them be.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What did you just say to me?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tazagthrog brought himself face to face with her.&amp;nbsp; “Leave them alone,” he said with gentle firmness.&amp;nbsp; “I’ll take them to the Outside: they can continue their journey from there.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turgolga’s hand struck his ear with especial venom.&amp;nbsp; He absorbed the blow as if he were made of rock.&amp;nbsp; Then, a growling hiss emanated from his throat as he reared up like a king cobra.&amp;nbsp; Turgolga raised her hand to strike him again.&amp;nbsp; As her open hand swung around, a much larger, more powerful hand lashed out at her cheek; she crashed to the ground and when she looked up, Tazagthrog’s scars danced on his heaving chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“How dare you?” She hissed.&amp;nbsp; “How dare you strike an ogress?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“How dare you strike an ogre?” He replied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turgolga’s mouth moved but no words came out.&amp;nbsp; She looked at Odessa, who lay at the edge of the cave and Trousers who stood guard over her, his hazel eyes shining defiantly in the moonlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It’s all because of her!” Turgolga shouted. “She’s worked some kind of magic on you.&amp;nbsp; You’re not the real Tazagthrog -- yes, that’s it -- you’ve been cursed by her, she’s robbed you of your scales!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turgolga heaved herself up and disappeared into the cave screaming and shouting for help.&amp;nbsp; Yugherkug emerged from the shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Father! What happened to you?&amp;nbsp; Where are your scales?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I'm free, Yugherkug.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“How can that be?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I have learned what it means to allow someone to reach out to you.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“How do you do that?&amp;nbsp; I want to get rid of my scales too.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Go to the place I told you about.&amp;nbsp; Learn to make more sketches, I left parchment and ink, drink and food for you, and then start journeying into the Great Beyond.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What lies in the Great Beyond?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I don't know, but you need to meet someone like Odessa, who can teach you the things we never learn here.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Can't you come with me?&amp;nbsp; I don't want to go alone.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It's too late for me, the others will be here soon and they will never let me leave now.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tazagthrog smiled at Yugherkug and extended his arms to him.&amp;nbsp; Yugherkug stepped forward; Tazagthrog hesitated slightly and then wrapped his arms around Yugherkug, who stiffened momentarily and then relaxed in his father's embrace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I'm sorry, Yugherkug.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Sorry for what?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I'm sorry I didn't stop your Cleansing.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“If you had tried, you would have had to face the Council.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I know, but I still should have tried.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They held each other silently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Goodbye, my son.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Goodbye, my father.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love you, my son.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What does 'love' mean, father?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It means being softer and tougher than ever before.&amp;nbsp; It means sharing something that no-one else can have, but it also means sometimes giving it up so that someone else can go on.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What are you going to give up for me?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turgolga returned with a crowd of astonished ogres and ogresses; Yugherkug faded back into the shadows as they approached.&amp;nbsp; Tazagthrog picked up Odessa and Trousers and held them to his chest.&amp;nbsp; When Yamizert pushed through the crowd she gasped.&amp;nbsp; She ran to her mother and clutched her hand.&amp;nbsp; Yugherkug stood in the shadows, entranced by his father’s pulsating scars and ran his hand along his own chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Look at what that little monster did to my ogreman!” Turgolga declared.&amp;nbsp; “I invited her into my home, kept her as a pet, made sure that no ogre would lay his hands on her, and see how she has repaid me!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crowd murmured in astonishment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- “Where are his scales?”&lt;br /&gt;- “Are those the scars from his Cleansing?”&lt;br /&gt;- “I’ve never seen an ogre without scales before.”&lt;br /&gt;- “He’ll have to have another Cleansing.”&lt;br /&gt;- “We can’t have an ogre walking around town without scales.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Tazagthrog has gone mad,” Turgolga declaimed.&amp;nbsp; “When I came up here he was in frenzied state; I tried to calm him, but he – he hit me!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crowd gasped&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It was all I could do to defend myself, luckily I escaped before he finished me off.&amp;nbsp; Look, look at these wounds!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crowd murmured excitedly as Turgolga pointed to the mild bruising on her face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- “An ogre hitting an ogress?”&lt;br /&gt;- “On purpose?”&lt;br /&gt;- “Poor Tazagthrog has lost it.”&lt;br /&gt;- “We need to set up the Cleansing immediately.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Tazagthrog,” Turgolga announced, “give me my pets back.&amp;nbsp; We need to dispose of these wicked creatures and prepare you for a Cleansing.&amp;nbsp; You’ve done a terrible thing, an unforgivable thing, but I can find it in my heart to forgive you if you grovel enough.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crowd advanced towards him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You don’t understand, Turgolga,” he replied.&amp;nbsp; “I’m not coming back.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crowd drew closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Goodbye, Turgolga.&amp;nbsp; I always loved you.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tazagthrog cocooned Odessa and Trousers in his arms, closed his eyes, and allowed himself to fall backwards off the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tazagthrog's body glowed like a falling star as they made their long descent to the bottom of the canyon.&amp;nbsp; The night air rushed around him, but Odessa and Trousers were shielded from the wind.&amp;nbsp; As they fell, they were accompanied by the reflection of cats-eyes in the rock; time slowed down; it seemed they were in limbo.&amp;nbsp; Tazagthrog's hums vibrated through Trousers and Odessa; her eyes began to open.&amp;nbsp; The falling star completed its journey and found its resting place.&amp;nbsp; A mighty thud of bone and flesh on rock echoed around the canyon, but Odessa and Trousers were cushioned by his underbelly.&amp;nbsp; Tazagthrog's hands fell limply to his sides and he stared up into the sky.&amp;nbsp; His breathing was laboured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa woke up and looked around.&amp;nbsp; “Where are we?&amp;nbsp; What happened?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Turgolga found us.&amp;nbsp; She wanted to do away with us, but Tazagthrog saved us.&amp;nbsp; We’re at the bottom of the canyon.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“How did we get down here?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Tazagthrog jumped, but he protected us from the fall.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa looked up at the cave far, far in the distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Tazagthrog, are you alright?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He tried to get up, but succeeded only in folding his hands on his chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Oh, Tazagthrog, why did you do this to yourself to save us?&amp;nbsp; I’m so sorry I got you into all this trouble!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He looked at her with a softness in his eyes.&amp;nbsp; His breathing became more laboured and the scars began to dim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“No, Odessa, before I met you, I was nothing more than an ogre.&amp;nbsp; No-one ever reaches out to an ogre, no-one ever cares.&amp;nbsp; All my life I longed to be loved, but ogresses don’t allow themselves to love -- only to fear, only to hate -- and ogres aren’t allowed to be soft.&amp;nbsp; We live our whole lives in pain; we take it out on each other, on the animals we kill, on the rocks that we smash; but nothing has ever taken the pain away.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“But all I did was open my heart to you, Tazagthrog.&amp;nbsp; Why can’t the ogresses do the same?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I don’t know.&amp;nbsp; Everyone says that after my Cleansing I was changed; but I think it was Turgolga who really changed.&amp;nbsp; I healed from the knife and the fire, but she was the one that delivered the knife and ignited the fire.&amp;nbsp; On the inside I’ve always been Tazagthrog the Gentle (that’s what they used to say to make fun of me), but something delicate inside Turgolga was burned away that day.&amp;nbsp; It took me years to understand this; and when I did, there was nothing anyone could do about it.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He coughed painfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I’m sorry, Tazagthrog, I’m so sorry for all of this.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Don’t apologise.&amp;nbsp; Without you, I would have never had the courage to tell Yugherkug about my sketches.&amp;nbsp; Now he knows what it means to be held and loved, and he shall see the things I never had the words to say.&amp;nbsp; One day, Yugherkug will find a way to tell other ogres what I never could.&amp;nbsp; You've given us a great gift, Odessa, the gift of a kind touch.&amp;nbsp; I am happy now, happier than I ever could have been...”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tazagthrog closed his eyes with his hands on his heart.&amp;nbsp; A single large tear trickled down his cheek and crystallised into a pearl coloured orb that shone with a fading blue light, which rolled into Odessa’s hands.&amp;nbsp; The light of his scars faded completely.&amp;nbsp; He smiled as his breathing slowed and finally stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odessa laid her hand affectionately on Tazagthrog’s cheek, put the pearl into her backpack, and followed Trousers into the canyon.&amp;nbsp; After some time the canyon gave way to a ravine; the ravine to a beach; at the beach was a pier; at the end of the pier, Bridge #91 stretched out over the sea.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-11d53d01-09f2-ceab-f143-766101d327c7" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Shortly after Trousers went exploring, Odessa was roused by a simple, haunting melody in A Minor that drifted across the grass. &amp;nbsp;She followed the music back to the piano, where a young man was playing. &amp;nbsp;His long blonde hair cascaded down his back in a shower of perfect ringlets and his red beard was neatly trimmed. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Odessa tiptoed towards the piano and stood off to the side to watch. &amp;nbsp;On the ivory stage of the keyboard, his hands jetéd and glisséd with practised ease. &amp;nbsp;He inclined his head towards the heavens, almost as if he were about to kiss the air. &amp;nbsp;The music washed over Odessa; she felt tingles down her spine and goosebumps on her skin; her cheeks felt very warm and she found herself having to breathe deeply. &amp;nbsp;The sunlight draped over him like an ethereal cloak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Timotheos took Odessa into an intimate closed hold: cheek to cheek, chest to chest, his right arm around her side, his right hand firmly between her shoulder blades, her right hand in his left. &amp;nbsp;The piano played a slow, dreamy waltz; the trees around the clearing hummed a deep bass accompaniment, and tapped their branches together to form a rustling drumbeat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Timotheos and Odessa floated on the music around the piano. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;The stepped side to side, forward and back, swayed and turned, stopped and went. &amp;nbsp;Odessa didn’t know the steps but he lead her through an array of moves and movements with nothing but a light touch on her back, the flick of his wrist, the tips of his fingers, and the irresistible sway of his shoulders and hips. &amp;nbsp;She marvelled at the way they moved together. &amp;nbsp;She had never encountered this dance or heard this music, they contained familiar elements but combined them in strange new ways. &amp;nbsp;The music died down and the sun came back out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;They ended in a close embrace. &amp;nbsp;Odessa pressed her cheek against his; she didn’t want to let go. &amp;nbsp;His hands dropped to her waist; her hands sought out his shoulders. &amp;nbsp;“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Odessa,” he purred. &amp;nbsp;He smelled of almonds and spice and his warm breath made her ears tingle. &amp;nbsp;His beard felt like soft English grass. &amp;nbsp;His lips brushed her cheek and her fingers dug into his shoulders slightly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;“Maybe you can play something else for me?” She whispered hopefully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;He hummed a sigh; she breathed in deeply and his smell rushed to her head. &amp;nbsp;“One day,” he said sadly. &amp;nbsp;“One day, when I’m free.” &amp;nbsp;He cupped her cheek in his hand and inclined his head towards hers; the warmth of his breath reached out to her; their lips came within a hair’s breadth of each other. &amp;nbsp;He stopped, sighed, and pressed his forehead to hers. &amp;nbsp;He stepped back and guided her hands to the bottom of his ribcage. &amp;nbsp;“Think kind, happy thoughts,” he said. &amp;nbsp;Odessa thought of hugs and purrs, whispered words, gentle gestures, and stolen kisses. &amp;nbsp;An electric blue light appeared on his chest and outlined her fingers. &amp;nbsp;He pulled her hands away and cradled them in his; the palms of her hands were imbued with an ephemeral blue light.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;“You have the gift of a kind touch, Odessa. &amp;nbsp;You have a great power to share another’s pain. &amp;nbsp;Please be careful: there is only so much suffering you can draw into yourself.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;He let go of her, turned around, and disappeared down the path without a sound. &amp;nbsp;Odessa watched him leave. &amp;nbsp;A great heaviness overcame her limbs and her head felt like a helium balloon. &amp;nbsp;She pressed her hair to her face; she could still smell almonds and spice. &amp;nbsp;Her feet came unstuck and she shook her head as if to wake up from a dwaal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Odessa took off down the path after him. &amp;nbsp;It meandered through the garden, up the hills, through a maze (at the centre of which stood the statue of a cat on a brick wall), over a footbridge across a brook, until it ended at the edge of the floating island, where a Victorian street lamp now stood patiently in front of Bridge #135. &amp;nbsp;Timotheos stepped on to the bridge, turned to face her, closed his eyes and placed his hands over his heart. &amp;nbsp;A cloud drifted across the bridge and when it floated away, Timotheos was gone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Trousers returned to find Odessa sitting with her legs crossed, her hands over her heart, staring at the clouds on the horizon. &amp;nbsp;Trousers stepped on to her lap and nuzzled her throat. &amp;nbsp;She wrapped her arms around him and kissed his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;As Bridge #135 carried them down through the sky, the piano in the clearing played a sad, wistful tune.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

&lt;h2&gt;
Chapter VI: The Cave in the Canyon&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Thomas_Moran_-_Grand_Canyon_of_the_Yellowstone.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Thomas_Moran_-_Grand_Canyon_of_the_Yellowstone.jpg" height="184" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Bridge #135 took Odessa and Praetorius Pathfinder XII (known to his friends as Trousers) into the depths of a canyon. &amp;nbsp;They arrived at the opening of a great cave high up in the wall of the sheer cliff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;As they stepped off the final slat exploded in a rush and the rest of the bridge disintegrated and faded into the darkness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;In the morning sun, Odessa’s shadow stretched into the cave, but beyond the entrance it fell into darkness. &amp;nbsp;Odessa pulled out a flashlight from her bag. &amp;nbsp;It had been a birthday present from a strange old man who joined her family on their travels for a while. &amp;nbsp;When they set up their stalls and street performances, he walked around town chatting with people and somehow always convinced them to buy something or see a show. &amp;nbsp;He never rushed, yet he always got everything done. &amp;nbsp;He wore long flowing clothes and had a long white beard; he was the only adult Odessa knew he understood what her animals were saying. &amp;nbsp;On her birthday, he gave her the flashlight and promised her that as long as she looked with an open heart it would show her the way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Trousers sniffed the air suspiciously. &amp;nbsp;“I don’t like the smell of this place,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;The walls of the cave narrowed to a tall, broad tunnel. &amp;nbsp;There were animal bones and brown smears on the walls, and the sound of water dripping. &amp;nbsp;They reached a fork in the tunnel; Odessa stood there, wondering which way to go, when she heard lumbering footsteps and the sound of bodies dragging on the ground coming from the tunnel to her right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;She stepped into the tunnel to her left and the outline of a pair of giants came into view. &amp;nbsp;One dragged a collection of lifeless enormous sheep, goats, and cows behind him on a rope; the other carried a bundle of firewood under his arm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;“Let’s have a one of these as a snack at the Old Entrance.” &amp;nbsp;The first giant said in a deep, slow, almost childlike voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;“Good idea, I’ve been bashing rock all through the night and I’m starvin’.” &amp;nbsp;Said his friend, in a slightly less deep, but equally uninflected tone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

No! Ogres can’t create anything -- except for some primitive patterns, I suppose. &amp;nbsp;Everything here was created by the ogresses.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

(Although it sounded like a guttural snort) &amp;nbsp;“Clearly, you can’t tell the difference between creating and making. &amp;nbsp;The ogres did the stupid work of digging and carving, but you need ogresses to create the idea of doing so. &amp;nbsp;If you left an ogre to his own devices he’d simply bash his head against the rock, or rather bash another ogre’s head against the rock. &amp;nbsp;If it weren’t for the ogresses to keep the ogres in check, we’d all be huddled on the Entrance, shivering in the wind.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;“We do our best to keep them in check,” Turgolga sighed, “But life for an ogress was never meant to be easy.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Printable Book Form Now Available</title>
    <content type='html'>Some people like to read blog posts, others prefer to print out what they're going to read.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="375" mozallowfullscreen="" msallowfullscreen="" oallowfullscreen="" src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lobsterstew/242490177/player/7e17fa977d" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="500"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
To make it easier for those of you who still enjoy the traditional ink-and-paper approach, all of the published chapters of The Odessia are available in a single Google Doc.&amp;nbsp; Simply click in the Page link above called "Printable Version" and you will be taken to the Google Doc.&amp;nbsp; From there you can download it as a Word DOC, LibreOffice ODT, or PDF, amongst others.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Every week a new chapter shall be added both to the blog and the Google Doc. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here's a video on how to print from Google Docs:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;"What! How dare you?!" the mountain bellowed, "No-one can refuse me! &amp;nbsp;Get in there this instant!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;A blast of icy wind blew in from the abyss; Odessa felt herself being thrown off balance towards the opening. &amp;nbsp;She got down on all fours and crawled towards the wall. &amp;nbsp;A set of long, stick-like arms sprang out, writhing like a spider's legs, snatching wildly at the air above her head. &amp;nbsp;The arms and hands were deathly white, with long, red, sharp fingernails. &amp;nbsp;Odessa couldn't smell the warm cinnamon anymore; instead, a faint stench of gore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

Comrade said. &amp;nbsp;"I'm saying that we all got what we asked for, but it's not what we thought it would be."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;An army of long arms with red-taloned hands slithered from the wall and pulled him out of the wall up to his waist. &amp;nbsp;They swarmed his body, latching on to every of piece of him. &amp;nbsp;Comrade started to scream but was cut short as the hands ripped him apart and directed chunks of his flesh and bone towards the salivating, razor-toothed faces around him. &amp;nbsp;Before long, there was nothing left of Comrade except for a bloody stump in the wall, which suddenly swallowed his remains and closed itself, leaving a perfectly smooth section where he used to be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;

&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"&gt;Odessa looked for another way to leave the mountain, but her only option was the opening in the wall. &amp;nbsp;With her heart in her mouth, she tip-toed towards it and squeezed through.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
