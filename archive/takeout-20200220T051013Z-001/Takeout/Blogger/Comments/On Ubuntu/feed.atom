    <content type='html'>Agreed!  Obviously &amp;quot;Ocelot&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t ready for release yet, so it&amp;#39;s premature to judge it, but there&amp;#39;s some work to be done between now and October.
I lose control of my mouse pointer very frequently, for a couple of seconds at time.  My system has 4GB RAM, so I think it might have something to do with memory management as well as consumption, but I&amp;#39;m not terribly knowledgeable in this area.
Still, there&amp;#39;s a lot to like about Ocelot -- I just can&amp;#39;t relate to the Ubuntu haters out there.</content>
