    <content type='html'>Rania,

Thanks for your response.  I agree with your elaboration on the plight of Palestinian refugees in many Arab countries.  There is an African saying that springs to mind:

When elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers.</content>

    <content type='html'>Hi,

A thoughtful piece on the history of the conflict, and overall pretty fair.  I am a little concerned that you have not given enough attention to the misery of Palestinians not only in the West Bank and Gaza, but in other countries as well:

&amp;quot;Today, most Palestinians in the region suffer from uneducation, unemployment, disabilities, disease, and unsanitary conditions.&amp;quot;

(?) Don&amp;#39;t many of the Palestinians in these awful conditions languish in refugee camps that were set up in Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon (in addition to the West Bank and Gaza) in 1949 by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East?

(?) Shouldn&amp;#39;t we also blame the governments of Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon for refusing Palestinians to reside in their countries or become citizens?  

If only refugee Palestinians were being treated well in the Arab world; unfortunately, they are often neglected, being hidden from view in isolated camps in Palestine&amp;#39;s neighbours.  I would appreciate it if more attention were given to the plight of Palestinian refugees who miss out on the attention of scholarly debate and the international media.

Alexander,
