If, for some reason, you need to familiarise yourself with AngularJS, i.e. Angular 1, I can strongly recommend this free course by Scott Allen from Plural Sight:https://app.pluralsight.com/player?name=angularjs-get-started-m0&mode=live&clip=0&course=angularjs-get-started&author=scott-allenHe moves at a fast clip, so you'll probably pause a lot to keep up with his code, but it's a good introduction to the main features of Angular JS, especially if you're completely new to this kind of work.
