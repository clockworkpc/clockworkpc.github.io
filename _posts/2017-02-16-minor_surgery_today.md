Going in for surgery today.I will shortly go to an endodontic clinic (specialist dentist -- I learned about it only recently) for an operation under local anaesthetic.  The 'root' cause of my problem is a traffic accident I suffered as a teenager.  Seventeen years on, in spite of excellent dental care and oral hygiene, I need surgery to eradicate the problem.I hope to return to my coding work later today, but I suspect I'll have to take it easy for the rest of today, much though I'd like to keep on working hard.Wish me luck.
