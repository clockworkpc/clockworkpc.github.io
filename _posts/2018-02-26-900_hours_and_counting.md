This pomodoro cycle stretched out a fair bit.  At the beginning of the year my internship with Gleam.io came to an end (under the most favourable circumstances, for the very best of reasons) and I gave myself some time to review the experience and work out the next steps.Life got in the way of my studies for a while, but I've been plugging away at various online courses.  One of the best things about my time at Gleam is that I have much clearer idea of what I need to focus on in order to improve most rapidly.For the next while, my focus will be on front-end-related skills, especially HTML/CSS/JavaScript.  I'd like to get good at using Vue.js, which I know is a little niche at the moment, but I think it's the way to go for the next few years.  EDIT: In light of some advice from senior devs, I might focus on React.js instead for a while.At the beginning of this journey, I joked that I'd have complete 2,000 pomodoros (1,000 hours) before I'd be a strong enough candidate to land a permanent junior role.  I'm now at 1,800 pomodoros (900 hours) and my joke may turn out more prophetic than I intended it to be.
