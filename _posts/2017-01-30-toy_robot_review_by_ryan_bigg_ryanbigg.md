I have started working through a book called Toy Robot by Ryan Bigg, who explains in his introduction:In this book, I’m going to go through how I would implement the Toy Robot exercise myself in Ruby, just for demonstration purposes. I’ll be building it up piece-by-piece with the overall aim to be to help anyone reading how to think through and implement this problem.Having just completed "Learn Ruby the Hard Way" I hope to refine my skills by working through Bigg's book.All my posts about this book will be labeled "toyrobot", so you can call up all the posts to date at your leisure.As per the book, I used the bundler gem to create a project tree, which is made available on github: https://github.com/clockworkpc/toy_robotLet's see how it goes!
