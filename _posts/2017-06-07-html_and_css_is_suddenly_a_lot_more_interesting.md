I don't know why, but somewhere into the freeCodeCamp HTML/CSS foundations challenge, I suddenly found myself enjoying it. Â I am, of course, quite familiar with the basics of HTML and CSS, but I had never found it especially compelling; I was happily absorbed in Ruby for hours and hours, but couldn't have imagined that I'd enjoy the building blocks of front-end.Nevertheless, something clicked for me, and I am going to focus intensely on HTML and CSS for a while, before moving on to jQuery and JavaScript.
