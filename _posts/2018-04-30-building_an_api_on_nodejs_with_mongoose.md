I spent a couple more pomodoros than expected, but I cleared up a couple of points of misunderstanding about working with MongoDB.  Prima facie, NoSQL makes sense, and certainly seems more attractive than working with a relational database.  I've heard from some people who are more accustomed to working with MySQL and PostgreSQL that MongoDB doesn't scale well, but I don't have enough commercial experience of the two approaches to have an opinion yet.I find this approach, of writing the code out by hand, is an excellent way of forcing myself to slow down and meditate on the material.  I bear in mind that I save myself time on Stack Overflow in the long run; and at any rate, it makes me more self-reliant and better at RT(F)M.
