It's been a productive day of coding, although I got off to a late start.I completed both parts of Day 3 of Advent of Code without too much difficulty.  I knew fairly well what I wanted to do for the first part and misread the instructions for the second part.  Once I understand what I had got wrong, it was simply a matter of jotting down notes and thinking the problem through.  I skimped on the testing for it, which was naughty, so I'll have to be more disciplined in the future.
