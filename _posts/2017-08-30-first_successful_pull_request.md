The last three weeks have seen my eleventh pomodoro cycle (1,100 completed), and my first as an intern at Gleam.io.  My learning curve is very steep, for it includes, amongst other things:A new IDE. (Rubymine instead of Atom)Tighter security settings around my Github account, which is rather a good thing.Getting a large and complicated server with many dependencies running on my machine.Getting a new System76 Gazelle Linux box. (Amazing!)Writing RSpecs at a level of complexity far above anything I've learned.Using Rubocop — really not hard, I actually quite like it.Edging out the excitement of my very own System76 laptop — I've been on cloud nine since Gleam.io generously purchased it for me — is my first successful pull request.To a seasoned programmer, it was a small thing, but it is a momentous occasion for me.And may it be the first of many.
