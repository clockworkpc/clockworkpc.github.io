This cycle was dominated by study (black) -- Toy Robot, Ruby documentation, 'Rails 4 in Action' -- and job seeking (red) -- lots of calls, emails, and networking at the Ruby Conference (2017) in Melbourne, Australia.Let's see if we can make it two hundred pomodoros for the month of February.At any rate, it's been a very productive one hundred pomodoros so far.
