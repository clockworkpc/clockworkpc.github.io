Lots of coding exercises and interviews.Not much study or blogging, but most of what I have been working on is confidential, if you know what I mean. I should be interested to work out how many pomodoros I've put in since the new year -  about 100 per 2Â½ weeks. Whatever I'm doing it's starting to work, so I just have to keep at it.
