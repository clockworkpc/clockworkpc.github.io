Over the last seven months I have spent a thousand pomodoros (25-minute blocks), i.e. five hundred hours, in pursuit of a new career as a software developer.  The bulk of my time has been spent on the following:Studying coding (40% => 200 hours), Writing code (40% => 200 hours)Writing about this journey (10% => 50 hours), Networking and actively applying for jobs. (10% => 50 hours)And now I am pleased to announce that I have been granted an internship at Gleam.io as a back-end junior software developer.I am grateful to the team at Gleam for this opportunity to learn the ropes.  I am ever increasingly aware of how much there is for me to learn, but I will give it my best.Wish me luck!
