I have officially spent 400 hours in my pursuit of a career in software development.I summarised my achievements at the completion of 700 pomodoros, and I don't have an awful lot to add, except that I understand HTML and CSS a bit better and am in the process of refining my knowledge of programming fundamentals in Ruby.There are days when I feel a little disheartened by not having a job yet, but I knew it would be a long process when I started it and there's plenty to take heart from. Â Let's see how I'm situated by the end of this cycle.
