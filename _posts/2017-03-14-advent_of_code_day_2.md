Today was a fairly productive day.  I got off to a slow start, but I got back into the problem fairly quickly and managed to solve the first of the two puzzles of Day 2 of Advent of Code.  I'm still stuck on the second puzzle, but I believe the key lies in modifying the regex rule that's being applied to the input data.  I expect to get it done tomorrow morning.
