Mission WebDevMission DevOps is now Mission WebDev.  Nothing much else in the blog will change, but it represents the next stage in the evolution of my career as a software developer.  Since I updated my online profile to reflect this, I have attracted more interest, which is always a good sign.  I am working my way through a couple of courses online to lay a strong foundation for front-end development, so in this pomodoro cycle I have covered, inter alia, the following topics:HTML/CSS/JavaScriptBasics of HTMLBasics of CSSBasics of BootstrapBasics of JavaScript:Control FlowFunctionsArraysObjectsBasics of DOM ManipulationBasics of jQueryNodeJS (Mostly theoretical)V8 JS EngineNode coremodules, exports, requireEvents and the Event EmitterAsynchronous code, libuv, event loop streams, files, etc.Study GoalsMy goal for the next pomodoro cycle is to complete the following courses online:Learn and Understand NodeJS by Anthony AliceaIt's not an easy course because Alicea goes deep into the Node core and takes the time to explain concepts in exacting detail.  Lots of gestalt moments to be had.JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts by Anthony AliceaI'm so impressed by Alicea's treatment of NodeJS so far, that I trust his JavaScript course will give me the deep understanding I'm looking for.The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt SteeleA great educational framework.  I've put it on hold until I complete the other two courses, and will probably park it at certain points in order to supplement my knowledge in other areas, but it's the best overall guide to becoming a web dev that I've found so far.Coding ChallengeIn addition to the course, I've set myself the challenge of working my way through last year's Advent of Code in JavaScript.  If I can complete all these challenges, I'll be satisfied with my proficiency in JavaScript and be confident in mastering a web development framework.React or Vue?I'm still undecided, but it's probably not something I'll have to address before I hit 1,000 (!!!) hours in my mission to become a fully fledged (and employed) web developer.See you in a hundred pomodoros.
