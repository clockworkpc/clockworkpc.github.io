After many weeks of burning the midnight oil, my body has sent me a clear message:Take a break!It's a minor case of the flu, standard symptoms, and I am getting over it rapidly thanks to daily walks, cool showers, and plenty of naps.I expect to return to my 16-pomodoro-per-day schedule by the end of the week at the latest. Â My plan is to split my time between solving coding challenges, studying Ruby, and studying Rails.
