It was not a happy day when I passed the official milestone of 1,000
hours of trying to become a developer.&nbsp; I was still without a
job, and long, painful experience had taught me that interviews in
the offing counted for little.<br/>
<br/>
So I saved this photograph
in a draft of this post, wiped my board clean, and stenciled out the
twenty-first matrix.&nbsp; I intended to write a blog post about how
far I've come in my coding journey and all the things that I can work
with now, of which I had scant knowledge a year-and-a-half ago —
Ruby, Rails, coding puzzles, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.&nbsp;
Instead, I turned off my computer and went to the gym.<br/>
<br/>
A
career change is always hard, and these days no-one cares much for
the travails of a married man who dreams of providing for his
family.&nbsp; Looking for work is laborious, thankless, frustrating,
exhausting, and depressing.&nbsp; But what's the alternative?&nbsp; I
had to keep on going.<br/>
<br/>
So the next day I turned on my
System76 computer, for which I am most grateful, and spent the next
few days studying hard on Udemy.&nbsp; I put thoughts of whether I
might get a job out of my mind and concentrated on studying and
writing code — which, despite all the frustrations, I enjoy for its
own sake — and to cut a long story short, fortune smiled on me two
weeks later.<br/>
<br/>
Those of you who follow me on LinkedIn will
have noticed a small, but rather important update in my profile:</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-O2WHIMnWPZo/WxiJTDXhwtI/AAAAAAAAa0U/TjhZPKH6NVY-0GDKWSM9efYf9A490sPLQCLcBGAs/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2018-06-07%2B11-24-02.png">

It's been two weeks in the job and I've almost
completed a full cycle of pomodoros of productive work.&nbsp; After
going to roughly twenty interviews, someone finally agreed to give me
a chance, and I think my colleagues will agree that I've grabbed it
with both hands.<br/>
<br/>
So, it didn't take me exactly 1,000
hours, but rather 1,015½ hours, but what do I have to show for it?&nbsp;
A mission accomplished and a career change effected.<br/>
<br/>
Of
course, in an important way, my work has only just begun: time is
limited and there's lots to learn.<br/>
<br/>
But if there's one
thing I'm good at, it's making the most of my time.<br/>
<br/>
Tick,
tock, and all that.</p>
