A little bit of tinkering in Coffee script to make it simpler to type <%= %> in EJS and other template packages.  It works for me, so I cloned the source code from git and sent a pull request on a proposed branch.  It took two pomodoros away from my studies, but I think it's worth it in the time and effort and frustration it will save me.  Also, it's neat to tinker with a package to make it better — there's value in it for its own sake.
