Most of my day is spent sitting in a chair, and although there have been many days more sedentary than I should have liked, it's a boost to complete a full fitness pomodoro cycle.If I exercise five times a week, this should take me twenty weeks to complete, but life got in the way this year.Oh well, every bit counts.
