My beloved helped me to create a handy stencil for my white board, with which I make a chart like this:The chart works like this:Black = Study, i.e reading about Ruby, learning the concepts.Green = Code, i.e. working on code that goes to Github.Blue = Blogging.Red = Job search, i.e. applying for jobs, calling recruiters, etc.This is literally a progress chart, in the sense that it represents my progress, rather than how much of a goal I have completed.The twist of setting up the 10x10 table with a repeating pattern of four colours, instead of a neater set of coloured columns, is that gaps are unsightly.  Each of these four aspects of my mission is equally important, and the discomfort of seeing an uneven distribution of filled cells induces me to turn my attention to activities I have been neglecting.To be honest, I do not enjoy looking for work, and would much rather be busy coding and studying.  Blogging isn't too bad, but coding is more fun.Nevertheless, until I get my first gig, my job is looking for work, and so the red cells have to be filled in first.So far, so good.
