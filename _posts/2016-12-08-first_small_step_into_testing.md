I am working on Exercise 28 of Learn Ruby the Hard Way and this is my first concrete example of using testing in the course of coding.The exercise is a test of boolean logic: I am given a statement e.g.true == trueAnd must work out whether it is "true" or "false".As you can see, I have organised the statements in a two-dimensional array in which each sub-array is composed of three elements: a string denoting the statement, the statement itself, and my prediction.# List of boolean statements to test my knowledge thereof, organised in a two-dimensional arraybooleanTest = [  ["true && true", true && true, true],  ["false && true", false && true, false],  ["1 == 1 && 2 == 1", 1 == 1 && 2 == 1, false],  ['"test" == "test"', "test" == "test", true],  ["1 == 1 || 2 != 1", 1 == 1 || 2 != 1, true],  ["true && 1 == 1", true && 1 == 1, true],  ["false && 0 != 0", false && 0 != 0, false],  ["true || 1 == 1", true || 1 == 1, true],  ['"test" == "testing"', "test" == "testing", false],  ["1 != 0 && 2 == 1", 1 != 0 && 2 == 1, false],  ['"test" != "testing"', "test" != "testing", true],  ['"test" == 1', "test" == 1, false],  ["!(true && false)", !(true && false), true],  ["!(1 == 1 && 0 != 1)", !(1 == 1 && 0 != 1), false],  ["!(10 == 1 || 1000 == 1000)", !(10 == 1 || 1000 == 1000), false],  ["!(1 != 10 || 3 == 4)", !(1 != 10 || 3 == 4), true]]I test my prediction by running the following testing loop, and in keeping with the practice of "green" for good and "red" for error, I installed the colorize gem and applied it to the output of the testing loop.# Required in order to highlight the text in the testing loop green or red.# Colorize gem to mark the result green or red.require 'colorize'# Testing loopputs "Here are the results of my test:\n\n"booleanTest.each do|description,result,prediction|  puts "PREDICTION: #{description} GIVES #{prediction}, RESULT: #{result}"  if prediction == result    puts "Correct!".colorize(:green)  else    puts "Incorrect!".colorize(:red)  endendAnd here are the results:
