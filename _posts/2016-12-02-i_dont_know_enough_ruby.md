I have a confession to make: I don't know enough Ruby yet.I have working through the Ruby course on Code Academy, but that doesn't make me a Rubyist.I am working through Learn Ruby the Hard Way, but that still doesn't make me a Rubyist.Every day, I get a little better and learn a little more, but I'm still not fluent, I still can't attack a problem and begin to break it down into manageable components; I still need to learn the fundamentals of taking input from one source, manipulating it, and putting it into another place or displaying it.I know from studying (human) languages, that there isn't a clear milestone after which one says, "I speak this language."  Languages, be they human or computer, don't work that way.That's part of the reason for this blog: to remind myself of how far I've come at times when the holy grail of programming genius -- not a realistic goal -- seems out of reach.So, one chapter, one task, one problem, one exercise at a time.  It all adds up, and besides, there's no other way.
