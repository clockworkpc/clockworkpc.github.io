Make sure to include the name of the module in the method:module GameDictionary  def GameDictionary.scene_enter()    puts "This scene is not yet configured. Subclass it and implement enter()."    exit(1)  endEverything else is rather straightforward, but for some reason I keep on missing that detail.Â  I'll just keep on drilling it until it sinks in.In other words, I'll keep on crashing until I learn how to fly this damn aeroplane :)
