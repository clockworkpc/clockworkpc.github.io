Having reviewed my solutions to the first three Days of puzzles of Advent of Code, I am now comfortably proficient in the fundamentals of programming in pure Ruby.When presented with a problem, I am confident that I can do the following:Define the problemDescribe the solution broadly in programming termsDenote the likely classes and methods to be used thereinThereafter, I am now confident that, given enough time, I can solve the problem.  There is room for vast improvement, but that will come with time.I really enjoy the daily solution of programming puzzles, and would love to solve all fifty; however, my duty is to prioritise my studies according to optimal employment criteria, and there aren't a lot of jobs going for junior developers who specialise in solving fun puzzles in pure Ruby.Having passed this milestone in my learning, I am now ready to hit the books again.  My study plan encompasses the following:Build a website in Ruby on Rails to showcase my Advent of Code puzzle solutions.  This includes the following:Deep knowledge of RailsProficiency in JavascriptProficiency in JQueryProficiency in HTML/CSSProficiency in PostgreSQL and/or mySQLWriting automated tests in RSpec (my preference) or Factory GirlHost the website on HerokuAdditionally, I will further my knowledge of the following:CoffeescriptHamlAmazon Web Services: it would be good to know which services are of the highest priority, as one could spend a lifetime on there.To gain experience in upgrading older Rails versions, I could probably clone the source code of an existing Rails to a virtual machine, on which an old version of Rails is installed.  However, this is a lower priority.As all who know me can attest to, I can learn and work quickly and efficiently, and am adaptable and resilient.  I also take pride in managing expectations between multiple clients and communicating with both clients and colleagues.For the next couple of weeks I will focus primarily on the Rails framework by working through Ryan Bigg's promisingly large tome: Rails 4 in Action.  In this way I expect to establish a thorough grounding in Rails and also a gain a perspective on the changes from Rails 4 to Rails 5, which could come in handy if I ever work on a legacy codebase.
