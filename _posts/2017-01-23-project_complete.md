I have finished re-writing my text adventure game, Tree House Prince, available here: (https://github.com/clockworkpc/tree-house-prince)It is a very simple game, but I am proud of all the things I learned to get it into this shape.The game demonstrates my grasp of conditionals, classes, inheritance, and automation testing.  Every scene in the game has full module testing in Rakefile; the integration testing has to be done manually at this stage.  (I will learn about that soon!)
