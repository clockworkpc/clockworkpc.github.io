Pomodoro CountSince the beginning of this year (2017), I have invested a total of 700 pomodoros towards the following: Studying programming Coding Looking for work Self-promotion on social media What Do I Have To Show for My Efforts? I have a growing body of code: https://github.com/clockworkpc I have interviewed strongly for junior positions at a number of companies: Envato (2nd round) Zendesk (1st round) reinteractive (2nd round) GreenSync (3rd round) MYOB (3rd round) BlocksGlobal (3rd round) The feedback has been overwhelmingly encouraging, and with each interview, there is evidence that I am even closer to having the package of skills and knowledge that will distinguish me from other candidates.  Moreover, most of the companies have pointed out to me the precise areas of improvement, and I have incorporated their feedback into my curriculum. Do I have a job yet? No. Am I moving inexorably in the right direction? Absolutely. What Is A Pomodoro? Italians have been bemused by this term ever since, I imagine. One pomodoro is 20 minutes of pure, uninterrupted, focused work. For about 60 seconds before I start the clock, I orient myself; for about 60-120 seconds after the clock rings, I summarise my work. Add to that the time spent getting up from my desk and making notes on the whiteboard, and that comes to about 25 minutes when all is said and done: Preparation: 1 minute Pomodoro: 20 minutes Summary: 2 minutes Whiteboard: 2 minutes Rest: 5 minutes Thus, allowing five minutes of rest between a pomodoro and its surrounding activities, one pomodoro amounts to half an hour of productive labour. Working on the assumption that about five hours of a software developer&#39;s eight-hour day are spent on his primary task (coding), and the rest is taken up by meetings, etc, this means that 700 pomodoros are the equivalent of... 350 hours of productive labour 70 working days of productive labour 14 working weeks of productive labour Pomodoros: A Photographic Overview Unfortunately, I did not record my pomodoro counts fastidiously from the outset, so some of the data are missing, but a glance across photographs of the completed pomodoro cycles, shows that the amount of time spent on each activity varied.  Sometimes I was focused on my studies, sometimes on coding, sometimes on looking for work. I spend the least amount of time on promoting myself through social media, which makes sense, because it is more important to me to learn how to code, to code, and to look for work, than to blog and network on LinkedIn and Twitter. 2nd of January 2017 to 15th of January 2017 (100) 16th of January 2017 to 30th of January 2017 (200) (Image lost to oblivion) 31st of January 2017 to 15th of February 2017 (300) 16th of February 2017 to 6th of March 2017 (400) 7th of March 2017 to 30th March 2017 (500) 1st April 2017 to 23rd April 2017 (600) (Image lost to oblivion) April 24th 2017 to 10th of May 2017 (700)" />
