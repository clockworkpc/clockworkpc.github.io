There are many things that give me encouragement, regardless of the outcome of my job application. I can code. I have a lot to learn, I make many mistakes, my code is probably inefficient and clumsy, but I can take a problem and solve it through the code.  It is a sort of &quot;hello world&quot; moment for me. What I do works. As I have been teaching myself, it is always hard to gauge whether I&#39;m getting things right, or whether I ought to sign up for a course instead.  I am more convinced than ever that I am on the right path, and can take pride in my work ethic, time management, knowledge, and skill. For example, I got stuck on writing Rspec tests, so I purchased an Rspec manual, studied it for precisely three pomodoros (black cells) and found I could write the tests I need. I have spent so far 3 x 20 minutes on study and 33 x 20 minutes on planning, writing, and coding for this exercise. The brevity of the study break excites me, because it is tangible, documented evidence that I have the intelligence, self awareness, and discipline to take a break from the main project, learn what I need, and then get back to work without wasting time.  I will succeed. If I get the job at Envato that would be great, and if I don&#39;t I shall certainly be disappointed.  However, I am much closer to being the best pick for a junior spot somewhere out there, and I won&#39;t relent until I&#39;ve achieved this goal. I am grateful to Envato for granting me an interview and the opportunity to show them what I can do.  Let&#39;s see what they make of it." />
