I know that alliteration makes the set mnemonic, but a better word to my mind is determination. &nbsp;Passion can wane in the face of difficulty, but determination, or resolve, or just plain grit (or vasbyt in Afrikaans) will see one through the steepest of climbs. &nbsp;Yes, I am passionate about the things I do, but unless I am determined to see something through, I can&#39;t rely on passion alone.

When I was 16 I decided that I wanted to speak Afrikaans -- a strange goal, admittedly, but bear with me. &nbsp;I had no resources but a novel (Die Koperkan by Mikro) and a school dictionary. &nbsp;Over six months I diligently translated entire chapters word for word, until I had built up enough of a vocabulary, and could understand pronunciation, grammar, and syntax to communicate in Afrikaans. &nbsp; I put in six months of solitary study and came out of it with a meaningful grasp of the language: that&#39;s what I had to show for my efforts.

  <div>I know that alliteration makes the set mnemonic, but a better word to my mind is determination. &nbsp;Passion can wane in the face of difficulty, but determination, or resolve, or just plain grit (or <i>vasbyt</i> in Afrikaans) will see

    translated entire chapters word for word, until I had built up enough of a vocabulary, and could understand pronunciation, grammar, and syntax to communicate in Afrikaans. &nbsp;</div>

  <div><br /></div>
  <div>There are loads of <a href="https://missiondevops.blogspot.com.au/p/learning-resources.html" target="_blank">resources for learning to code out there</a>, but unless I apply my newly acquired knowledge by way of a program that is useful

    be part of that.</div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>In light of that, I treat my <a href="https://github.com/clockworkpc" target="_blank">Github profile</a> and my <a href="https://gist.github.com/" target="_blank">Gist</a> as my résumé, and invite you to see what I've got so far.
