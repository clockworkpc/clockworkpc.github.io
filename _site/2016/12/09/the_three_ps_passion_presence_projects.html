<meta name="description" content="To be a successful programmer, I have been told, one needs to have the three &quot;Ps&quot;: Passion, projects, and presence. Passion or Determination? I know that alliteration makes the set mnemonic, but a better word to my mind is determination. &nbsp;Passion can wane in the face of difficulty, but determination, or resolve, or just plain grit (or vasbyt in Afrikaans) will see one through the steepest of climbs. &nbsp;Yes, I am passionate about the things I do, but unless I am determined to see something through, I can&#39;t rely on passion alone. Projects: AKA What Do You Have To Show For It? When I was 16 I decided that I wanted to speak Afrikaans -- a strange goal, admittedly, but bear with me. &nbsp;I had no resources but a novel (Die Koperkan by Mikro) and a school dictionary. &nbsp;Over six months I diligently translated entire chapters word for word, until I had built up enough of a vocabulary, and could understand pronunciation, grammar, and syntax to communicate in Afrikaans. &nbsp; I put in six months of solitary study and came out of it with a meaningful grasp of the language: that&#39;s what I had to show for my efforts. There are loads of resources for learning to code out there, but unless I apply my newly acquired knowledge by way of a program that is useful at least to me, I can&#39;t very well convince someone else to pay me do the same. What attracts me greatly to this line of work is that there is minimal paperwork involved: if you&#39;re good enough and are a good fit for the team, you stand a good chance of getting hired. &nbsp;I like that, I respect that, and I want to be part of that. In light of that, I treat my Github profile and my Gist as my résumé, and invite you to see what I&#39;ve got so far. &nbsp;(At the time of writing, most of what I have to show for my efforts is in Gist, but I hope to change that over December and January) Presence: Networking, Schmoozing, Putting Yourself Out There For the most part I enjoy being left alone to my own devices. &nbsp;Fortunately, socialising, especially one-to-one and in small groups is not difficult for me, but heading out to the city for events can be tiring. &nbsp;It is easy to assume that programming is solitary in nature, because an outsider sees individuals absorbed in their work, but working in a team and getting on with one&#39;s team mates are equally important. Those who know me trust my abilities and my work ethic, but as a new-comer to the profession, especially in my position of looking for my first job (presumably entry-level or junior), I have to distinguish myself from the hordes of would-be and aspiring programmers.
