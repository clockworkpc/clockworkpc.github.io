    <pre class="brush:plain">Here's your file ex_15_sample.txt<br /><br />This is stuff I typed into a file.<br /><br />It is really cool stuff.<br /><br />Lots and lots of fun to have in here.<br /><br />Type the filename again: ex15.rb:20:in `initialize': No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - <b><span style="color: red;">This is stuff I typed into a file. </span></b>(Errno::ENOENT)<br /><br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>from ex15.rb:20:in `open'<br /><br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>from ex15.rb:20:in `&lt;main&gt;'</pre>
  </div>
  <div>Let's look a little more closely at what went wrong. &nbsp;</div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>The first part of the script took the argument from the commandline and read the contents of the file ex_15_sample.txt -- great!</div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>Then it printed "Type the filename again." -- again, that's what we want.</div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>However, when it got to gets.chomp, it attempted to take as an input <b>the first line of the contents of the file</b> denoted by ARGV.</div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>Let's look at the contents of the text file in question:</div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;">ex_15_sample.txt:</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <pre class="brush:plain"><span style="color: red;"><b>This is stuff I typed into a file.</b></span><br /><br />It is really cool stuff.<br /><br />Lots and lots of fun to have in here.</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>Do you see what Ruby tried to do here? &nbsp;<i>gets.chomp</i>&nbsp;already has the filename from ARGV, but <i>instead of reading the filename, it reads the first line of the file</i>.</div>
  <div>
    <h2 style="text-align: left;">Scenario 3: gets.chomp with a hacked input file</h2>
  </div>
  <div>If gets.chomp take the first line of the file named by ARGV, what would happen if I hack the text file and put the name of the second file in the first line?<br /><br />

  </div>
  <div>
    <ol style="text-align: left;">
      <li>The first part of the script read the input file from ARGV.</li>
      <li>The second part of the script <i>read as input the first line of the input file from ARGV</i>.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 style="text-align: left;">Conclusions</h2>
  </div>
  <div>
    <ol style="text-align: left;">
      <li>If you want to prompt the user for input, use $stdin.gets.chomp.</li>
      <li>If you want to trick the program into using the first line of the first file supplied to ARGV, gets.chomp is an option, but a better way to do it would simply be to declare the variable in your code.</li>
    </ol>
