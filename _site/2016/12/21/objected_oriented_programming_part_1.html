Subclass it and implement floorSelection().&quot; exit(1) endend But remember that the floorSelection function is a while loop, so it needs a constant to hold true while it runs.  The obvious candidate is the floor number, so the function takes an argument and starts like this: def floorSelection(floorNumber) puts &quot;Filler text for the moment&quot; currentFloor = floorNumber while currentFloor == floorNumber From there it&#39;s simply a matter of pasting the rest of the floorSelection(floorNumber) function into the sub-class &#39;HouseScene&#39;.Then, for each room, call the functions: enter() floorSelection() If the player leaves the room, she will go back to the landing of the staircase and choose again whither she wants to go.This slightly more complex code brings me finally to the point where testing my program becomes a drag.  Until now, I could effortlessly run a straightforward program from start to finish; now, I have many potential routes to follow, and testing them all will take exponentially more time as I add games and puzzles to each room.In my next post I will share my first experience of testing and Rake files in Ruby." />

<br />But
              copy-pasting all of this would violate the <a href="http://infogalactic.com/info/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank">DRY principle</a>, so I thought about how to write it better:<br />
              <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>All 'Scenes' use the enter() function.</li>
                <li>All the rooms are 'Scenes'.</li>
                <li>All the rooms are 'Scenes' that require the same function for selecting a floor.</li>
                <li>Ergo, all the rooms are 'Scenes' use a function that could be defined as 'selectFloor()'.</li>
                <li>However, every room is located on a particular floor, which changes whether the player goes up or down the stairs, or is already at that floor.</li>
                <li>Ergo, every 'House Scene' needs to inherit the function 'selectFloor()' but with a variable for its floor, i.e. 'selectFloor(floorNumber)'</li>
              </ul> First, I created a sub-class of 'Scene' called 'HouseScene':<br />
            </div>
            <pre class="brush:ruby gutter:false">class HouseScene &lt; Scene<br /><br />  def floorSelection()<br />    puts "This scene is not yet configured.  Subclass it and implement floorSelection()."<br />    exit(1)<br />  end<br /><br />end<br /><br /></pre>
          </div>
<br />But remember that the floorSelection function is a while loop, so it needs a constant to hold true while it runs.  The obvious candidate is the floor number, so the function takes an argument and starts like this:<br />
        </div>
        <pre class="brush:ruby gutter:false">  def floorSelection(floorNumber)<br />    puts "Filler text for the moment"<br />    currentFloor = floorNumber<br />    while currentFloor == floorNumber<br /><br /></pre>
<br />From there it's simply a
        matter of pasting the rest of the floorSelection(floorNumber) function into the sub-class 'HouseScene'.<br /><br />Then, for each room, call the functions:<br />
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
          <li>enter()</li>
          <li>floorSelection()</li>
        </ul>If the player leaves the room, she will go back to the landing of the staircase and choose again whither she wants to go.<br /><br />This slightly more complex code brings me finally to the point where testing my program becomes a
        drag.  Until now, I could effortlessly run a straightforward program from start to finish; now, I have many potential routes to follow, and testing them all will take exponentially more time as I add games and puzzles to each room.<br /><br />In
        my next post I will share my first experience of testing and Rake files in Ruby.
